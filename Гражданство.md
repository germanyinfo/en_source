#### Transition from Russian to German citizenship (![](files/ru.gif))

You can reaccept your German citizenship by renouncing your own if you have met all the conditions [§10 StAG](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/stag/__10.html) (you have income, a sufficient period of residence, a German language certificate, etc.), for example:
* Eight years of residence + B1 language skills
* Seven years of residence + B1 level language skills + Integrationskurs
* Six years of residence + Integrationskurs + B2 language certificate
* Three years of residence + Integrationskurs + B2 language certificate + spouse with German citizenship
* and so on

The method of obtaining:
* To obtain an apostille certificate that the applicant is ready to apply for German citizenship:
  * At Standesamt (analogous to a civil register office) (e.g. at [Berlin] (https://www.berlin.de/standesamt/standesaemter-in-berlin/)): you will be interviewed for citizenship and will be asked what other documents you can bring with you
  * at the VHS (e.g. in one of the [Berlin] (https://www.berlin.de/vhs/)): sign up for [Einbürgerungstest] (https://www.berlin.de/vhs/service/einbuergerung/deutscher-einbuergerungstest/) to answer questions such as: "What year did the Nazis come to power" and "what was the first line in the current anthem?
  * to the Standesamt to bring the test result and all the documents requested  
  * After a while, a letter will come out of the Standesamt with a certificate of citizenship
  * At Bürgeramt (e.g. at [Berlin] (https://service.berlin.de/standorte/buergeraemter/)): apostille on the readiness certificate  
* to free myself from the bonds of the Motherland:
  * Tax office in the Russian Federation: personally visit the country, take a certificate of absence of tax debts. It is valid for 3 months
  * If you are still registered in the Russian Federation: go to the country personally, sign out with the reason `decreased for permanent residence in Berlin`. Remotely does not work.
* [Withdraw from Russian citizenship] (http://grajdanstvo-ru.ru/kak-otkazatsya-ot-grazhdanstva-rf.html):
  * At the sworn translator: translate the certificate of readiness and its apostille into Russian
  * at the [Consulate of the Russian Federation] (Consulate.md): certify translations
  * At the Consulate of the Russian Federation: submit an application for renunciation of citizenship with the reason `obtaining citizenship of Germany` with annexes:
    * Certified translations of the certificate of readiness and its apostille
    * No tax arrears certificate
    * A stamped envelope with your address
    * Paid [state duty](https://base.garant.ru/10900200/fce40d57dbbe868a22b8d51b0513287a/)
  * In a couple of months, an envelope comes in with a notification
  * at the Consulate of the Russian Federation: to give away domestic and foreign passports, to receive a certificate of loss of citizenship of the Russian Federation
* To get German citizenship:
  * in Standesamt: give the certificate of loss of citizenship of the Russian Federation, say `I will be a good burger` and get a temporary passport
  * Order the change of letters in the name to more euphonious ones (Aleksandr -> Alexander, for example) and remove the patronymic
  * At Bürgeramt: apply with a photo and a temporary passport for [Personalausweis] (https://service.berlin.de/dienstleistung/324325/) and a passport
