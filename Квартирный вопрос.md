# The apartment question

Apartments in Germany are searched for only in person, with a visit and inspections. It is not possible to find a good option for a long time remotely. Therefore, the sequence usually looks like this:
- You haven't arrived yet, but you are looking for a place to stay for the first time. For the most part, there are only two options - **Airbnb**/**https://www.mrlodge.com/** or an agency (see list below). You can try to write to the hosts on the ads, but the chance to get a contract disappears. **Attention**: Find out in advance so that you can register (Anmeldung).  Otherwise, it may be difficult to get insurance, SCHUFA or open a bank account.
- You have already arrived, you have gone to work, but you are on probation (or on a temporary contract, which is even worse), you have not yet received your wages, perhaps you do not speak German. At this stage, your task is to get at least some kind of rental contract for more or less long term (at least six months or a year). Due to the input data "just arrived", it will be quite difficult, because competition among tenants is high, the apartment can be claimed by dozens, if not hundreds of people (in Berlin easier, in Munich more difficult). But practice shows that in 3-4 weeks there are usually options. Prepare to check new ads several times a day in the first month, print out packs of documents and spend the evenings on numerous inspections of apartments. Don't despair, sooner or later, and there will be a holiday on your street.
- You are already "experienced", with a stable salary in recent months, there is an awareness of what's going on around you. You can look for a "dream apartment" rather than a "what you get". The process is no different from the previous stage except that now you look much more reliable for the landlords, so the offers should be noticeably more and the search time will be less.


## Step-by-step instructions
This section will focus on the second point of the search, as it is the most interesting. So, how to search for an apartment?

1. Choose any site from the list below, register there, fill out a profile if possible. To begin with, we recommend https://www.immobilienscout24.de/ aka "Scout" as the largest one.
2) Determine your search area(s). The closer you get to the center, the more expensive and difficult it is to take off. The most budget options are outside the city limits. Therefore, it is useful to study the transport scheme of the selected area, which modes of transport are there - S-Bahn, U-Bahn, Bus, Tram - and with what frequency. Plot a route in Google Maps from home to work and estimate the travel time, number of stops, distance from home / work, etc.
3. on the selected sites you can view the appearance of new apartments in the area of search. In the case of Scout, it is better to use the mobile application - it is in English and has wide functionality. It is recommended to create "Saved search", and then you will receive push notifications about new ads at the moment of their publication. The sooner you respond to an ad, the more likely it is that you will be called to view it. You can also set up notifications for email, FB Messenger or notifications in your browser. Keep in mind that demand is very high and the speed of response is important.
4. Prepare an "opening speech" - a message that will be sent to hosts when responding to the ad. It is recommended to write in either German or German and English. Invite colleagues or acquaintances to evaluate your work if you are not sure if you know the language.
5. **The most important thing!** Prepare a set of documents. This is exactly what will distinguish you among many other applicants for an apartment, it is possible with the best input data. When you give владельцу\агенту a pre-prepared folder with all your documents, instead of filling out the questionnaire on your lap in the dark with a pen that does not write - this is a very good plus in your favor. And since you probably don't have any other advantages at the moment, you should use the opportunity to the maximum. It is also recommended to put electronic copies of documents, for example, on Google Drive or Dropbox, and send a link to them immediately when responding to the ad.
6. As a matter of fact, everything is on your side. Now it remains to constantly check the service for new ads and respond to anything that looks as decent and fits into your budget.
7. If you are invited to the inspection - immediately agree and go. If you like everything in the apartment, then give the owner or agent your set of documents and hope for the best.
8. One day they will call you and say, "We are ready to rent you an apartment. You are happy, but not too much, because the contract has not yet been signed. You agree with your landlord on the contract, read it yourself or let your German-speaking colleagues read it, sign it - and that's where your torment ends. You can turn off the notifications, and, finally, in the morning your first thing will be not to view new ads and response, but shower and breakfast :). Waiting for the date of entry.
9. When accepting the apartment, look carefully at the condition, check plumbing, switches, electrical appliances, inspect the corners for mold. Record all malfunctions/faults/remarks, otherwise they will be written on you at the end of your contract. Do not forget about the conditions of return of the apartment (should be described in the contract): often the apartment is rented to you without furniture and freshly renovated, you will most likely have to whitewash all the walls and bring the flooring to its original condition (lacquer паркет\переложить laminate).
10. Get the keys to the apartment, garage, basement (optional) and start to enjoy life.


## Dictionary of the apartment question:
- Wohnung is actually a "home".
- Zimmer is a room, usually found in the context of "2 Zi Wohnung".
- Kalt - "cold", "basic" cost of rent, excluding utilities and other services.
- Nebenkosten - additional payments, usually including water, heating, etc. **Attention** - [electricity] (./electricity.md) is almost never included in Nebenkosten, it will have to be paid separately, as well as for the Internet.
- Warm is a "warm" price, usually Kalt + Nebenkosten, perhaps plus additional charges, for example, for a garage. In general, this is the amount that you will have to pay your landlord every month.
- Mieter is you, so you are the tenant.
- Vermieter is a landlord, the landlord who rents the property, the landlord.
- The Besichtigungs Termin is a personal meeting to examine the apartment.
- Mietvertrag - rental contract.
- WG (Wohngemeinschaft) - shared accommodation. When searching for a room, we are guided by this abbreviation.


## Documents
As described above, it is recommended to prepare a folder with all documents in advance. Namely:
- Questionnaire, so-called **Mieterselbstauskunft**. In the Internet there is a set of variants, one of the most simple and accessible here [this] (http://www.mietrecht-hilfe.de/media/downloads/Selbstauskunft-Mieter-Vorlage.pdf). The questionnaire for two persons if you are going to remove one, it is possible in the second column to put dashes. Fill in all truthfully, including your salary.
- The last three pay slips (**payslips**), if you have one, or at the end of a salary contract. Of course, you don't need to make a copy of the multipage contract, but be prepared to show it to the owner.
- **SCHUFA**. Something like your credit history, as well as some sort of evaluation of you as a payer. Even if you have just arrived, it is recommended to get it. Often, a beautiful sheet of "Zertifikat" is enough for the landlords to see that only positive entries have been found in your history, but particularly inquisitive landlords can also ask for a sheet that shows your score (**SCHUFA-Basisscore**). See details below.
- A letter of recommendation from work. Ask the company or your manager to write you something official on the company logo and seal form. The basic minimum is "confirm that such a person is working for our company from such a date on an open-ended contract".
- A letter of recommendation from the current (previous) owner. Most likely, even at a temporary apartment you will have an apartment owner or an agency - ask them to write you a letter about how good you are, pay your rent in time and do not make fires in the room. 
  The document is called Mietschuldenfreiheitsbestätigung or [Mietzahlungsbestätigung] (https://www.immobilienscout24.de/ratgeber/wohnungsbewerbung/mietzahlungsbestaetigung.html). 
  How to [request] (https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/4qwt9f/q_how_to_request/).
- Copy of passport. It is believed that it is better to put your signature on the copy.

The first three items belong to the must have category (Schufa, theoretically, can be shown later, but it is better to have all the documents in hand). The rest is optional, but highly recommended.


# SCHUFA
SCHUFA is a large German organization which, among other things, deals with credit histories and assessment of "reliability" of German residents. If you all pay on time, do not receive any fines and have a salary, there should normally be no problem. But late payments, frequent changes of the bank, malicious violations of laws (repeated travel without a ticket, for example), a large number of loans - all this can negatively affect your assessment, so it will be more difficult for you to find an apartment (which owner wants to rent out a malicious non-payer), the banks will refuse the loan or give out at a robbery rate, and so on.

Usually, SCHUFA is a credit history statement that includes a certificate of your reliability and a sheet of accurate SCHUFA-Basisscore (percentage from 0 to 100). The higher the score, the better. 95% and above is considered a good grade, 98% and above is ideal. The paperwork is valid for three to four months, which should be enough to find an apartment even in the most difficult cases.

How to get it:
  - If you need to find an apartment urgently, ask Postbank or Volksbank ([see branch map] (https://www.meineschufa.de/index.php?site=14_3)). You must have your registration (address in Germany), passport and a German bank account with you**. They do it in 10 minutes. The cost is 29.95 euros. Money will be deducted from the account within 1-2 weeks.
  - According to § 34 of the Bundesdatenschutzgesetz SCHUFA, you can get it free of charge once a year by filling out a paper form and sending it by post. Follow this very clear [instructions] (http://www.ratgeber-geld.de/schufa/auskunft.html). The form can be found [here] (https://www.meineschufa.de/index.php?site=11_3_1).
  - You can also get SCHUFA through a "scout" - [service link] (https://bonitaetscheck.immobilienscout24.de/). It costs 29.95 euros. Sent either to a mailbox or to download an electronic version. The bonus is a monthly trial period of the premium account (as of the beginning of 2018). If you don't need a premium account (and you probably don't need it), it's better to turn it off at once, because otherwise it will automatically last and Scout will quietly start to write off the subscription fee every month.

#Agency or owners?
Apartments can also be rented from companies, such as Wohnungsgenossenschaften, in addition to "private individuals".
  - The advantage is that the company has no disadvantages of "private parties", e.g. self-necessity, improper conduct of the landlord (strange requirements and prohibitions), legal aspects (e.g. less often cheating with Nebenkostenabrechnung).
  - Wohnungsgenossenschaften usually rent a house without a broker, i.e. you can save money on brokerage. 
  - Disadvantages: The waiting time for an apartment can be quite a long time for a Wohnungsgenossenschaften in Berlin, depending on the company and district (http://www.berlin.de/special/immobilien-und-wohnen/adressen/wohnungsbaugenossenschaft/).

# Blacklist
