# Invitation

It is possible to invite your friends or relatives to your home in Germany, which allows them to submit fewer documents than is generally required when applying for a visa. There are two types of invitations - informal and official (Verpflichtungserklärung).

In the case of an official invitation, you are the guarantor of your guest and are responsible for him/her during his/her stay in Germany. This includes accommodation (no hotel reservations required), financial sponsorship (no bank statement required), health insurance and repatriation. This is an official document and will require the original invitation when applying for a visa (i.e. you will need to mail it to them).

An informal invitation only relieves the guest of the need to provide the hotel reservation to the embassy, which is often sufficient, as there are known cases where the embassy monitors the status of the reservation and may even cancel the visa already issued if it finds out that the reservation has been cancelled. However, this is no longer an issue with the invitation.


## Unofficial invitation

Written in English or German, with the dates of the trip, your passport details and address, passport details and the home address of the guest, signed and scanned. The received scan is sent to the guest together with the scan of your passport and the BC and with these printouts the guest will go for a visa (of course, this does not relieve the guest of the need to have all the other documents required to apply for a visa). The main thing that gives the availability of an invitation - the ability to do without booking hotels.

The invitation template in DOCX format can be found [here] (files/Invitation_visa.docx)

#### General information

On the application form, you must specify at least the starting date of your Beginn der voraussichtlichen Visumgültigkeit am visa.
Since the maximum period of stay is 90 days, the clerk can also enter the date of expiry in the invitation. For multiple visits, it is necessary to write in the box what Multivisa, for example, requires: 15.10.2016 Multivisa für 2 Jahre. Then the "Planned length of stay" column of the invitation will contain something like a gewünscht Multivisa für 2 Jahre.
In one invitation you can specify the spouse of the invited person and his or her minor children.
If you wish to submit an invitation, you should also attach a handwritten invitation, which is always welcome at the embassies.

If the wife does not work to invite her parents, the invitation is from her husband. The wife should write a handwritten letter to the embassy, similar to an invitation. A sample letter for a short stay can be found [here] (https://github.com/ru-de/faq/blob/master/files/Einladung%20(short%20term).docx?raw=true), for a long one [here] (https://github.com/ru-de/faq/blob/master/files/Einladung%20(long%20term).docx?raw=true).
Relatives should also take the documents confirming their kinship to submit documents to the embassy.

For Russians, the visa fee for children is paid in any case (practice of inviting the wife's family, with financial support from her husband. Source: Consulate General in St. Petersburg).
