# Electricity

# How do I get the electricity to my new apartment?
A contract with Vatenfall will be concluded by default in Berlin. After a couple of months of staying in the new apartment you will receive a letter with documents and bank details to pay for the electricity. But since there are cheaper providers, it is recommended to change the provider from Vatenfall to another one. 

## Can I be left without any electricity?
No, the default provider will be automatically contracted. For Berlin this is Vatenfall

# I've got a letter of tariff change, what do I do?
Change provider. The consumer has a special right to terminate the contract early if the tariff is changed by the provider

# How do I change my ISP?
Choose a new provider, fill in the application online. They send the contract, sign and send it back. That's all. The company contacts Vatenfall itself. Then you pay for the electricity to a new provider.

A couple of popular providers in Berlin:
http://e-wie-einfach.de
Price: 28,90 ct/kWh + 100 € bonus for connection.
http://simplygreen.de. Renewable energy provider.
Price: 25,47 ct/kWh + 8€ mandatory monthly payment + gift bonus (large selection (bicycle, vacuum cleaner, etc.) full list here: https://www.simplygreen.de/praemien)

For comparison, the price of the cheapest rate in Vattenfall is 26.28 Cent/kWh + 8.80 mandatory monthly payment + 120 € of different bonuses.

To find a new provider you can use the search and comparison on [check24] (https://www.check24.de/strom/).

## How much does a family of two actually consume?
This question may arise because on sites with tariff calculators, consumption is usually very high. 
For example, it is assumed that 3500 kWh is needed for two people, although 2000 kWh should be enough for an ordinary family

## What if I don't have the kWh that I signed the contract for, what if I do the opposite?
If the tariff is not a package one, there are no problems. 
In case of recalculation, which takes place once a year, or in case of termination, the difference will be returned or it will be necessary to pay additional at the normal cost, 
which is listed in the rate.
