# Review
Operators with their own networks are [Vodafone] (https://www.vodafone.de/), [O2] (https://www.o2online.de/), [T-Mobile] (https://www.t-mobile.de/), [E-Plus] (https://www.handyflatrate.de/) (the latter was purchased by O2).

Contracts from real operators are expensive, you can take the phone in installments.

There are a large number of virtual operators, many of which (already) belong to [Drillish AG](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drillisch).
Usually, virtual operators offer lower tariffs, both prepaid and contractual.

For comparison of operators it is convenient to use the service [check24] (https://check24.de) - it shows not only the size of packets (traffic, minutes) and their cost, but also what real operator uses this virtual one, what happens when the traffic limit is exceeded - usually small additional packets are automatically sold at an inflated price, whether it is possible to disable these additional packets and stay at a limited speed, etc. The same speed can be reduced to different values, for example, O2 now (in summer 2017) is cut to megabit per second, not 16 kilobits, as in most other operators.
Tariffs change regularly, the information in this file below is most likely not relevant at the moment when you read these lines.

For example:
- [ALDI Talk](https://www.alditalk-kundenbetreuung.de/de) is a convenient prepaid option for the Internet, 10 euros per 2.5 GB ([Internet Flatrate L](https://www.alditalk.de/internet-flat-l)) or 15 euros per 5.5 GB ([Internet Flatrate XL](https://www.alditalk.de/internet-flat-xl)) per month throughout Germany. The SIM card costs 13 Euros, 10 Euros in an account. It is important that you activate your SIM card after purchasing it. You can do this at the bank or at the post office if you speak German. You can show your passport online via video call. Shop staff can do little to help you, you need to find the internet to activate it yourself. Actual as of February 2019. User testimonial: `O2, LTE was launched in 2018. Refill via coupons at the cash desk or you can make SEPA and immediately drop the money. The tariff works for a month (if you activate it on February 2, it will be switched off on March 2) and then the "standard", not very advantageous tariff will be activated.  Also from the pleasant: when the traffic is over - will be unlimited on 56KB / s, and not in the minus.

- [PremiumSIM](https://www.premiumsim.de/) is an interesting variant with a contract (not prepaid), but you can break it up in a month. 10 euros for 2-3 GB of Internet in Germany + 1 GB in EU, unlimited calls and SMS. Actual for July 2017
- [DeutschlandSIM](https://www.deutschlandsim.de/) - tariffs for Vodafone, O2 networks, you can select the number.
- [CallYa from Vodafone](https://www.vodafone.de/privat/handys-tablets-tarife/prepaid-ohne-vertrag.html). Prepaid, you can set up automatic debiting of the bank account.
- [Simply](https://www.simplytel.de/) - both prepaid and postpaid are possible.
- [smartmobile.de](https://www.smartmobil.de/) - virtual operator
- [yourfone](https://www.yourfone.de) - virtual operator
- [WinSIM](https://www.winsim.de/) - available tariffs including paid minutes and traffic in roaming.

## Transferring the number between operators
When changing operator, you can save the phone number. The process is not fast, formal, but it works with little or no misfire.
Typical changeover sequence from Provider A to Provider B (e.g. from ALDI Talk to PremiumSIM):
- Refill the account of Provider A so that the account has the necessary amount of money to open the number. Yes, this service is usually chargeable and costs about 25 euros. A little sweetens the pill, which is usually ~20 Euros for operator B if the number has been transferred, which means that the total cost is not as high.
- Write to Provider A that you wish to "unbind" the number. You need to fill in and sign the form, and then send it to the provider either by email or paper mail. In the case of ALDI Talk, all you have to do is send the scan to your e-mail address. The form (*Einwilligung zur Rufnummernübernahme*) can be found here (https://www.alditalk.de/downloads-formulare) or obtained directly from an employee after contacting the contact center.
- Waiting for confirmation that the number is open and available to the new operator. Usually it takes a few working days from the call to the confirmation, quite quickly. The number will be available for "capture" within 3 months.
- Notify Provider B that you want to move the number. Often this can be done immediately at the time of registration with Provider B, or send a separate request. In case of PremiumSIM request you can send it through your personal cabinet, there you can see the status of the request.
- Waiting for confirmation from Provider B. A little less than a week, they will send you an SMS with the date when the final transfer will be made
- After that date, everything should work, you're happy. The whole process from the submission of the application to operator A to the completion of the migration takes about 2 weeks.

# Buying a card
You can buy in supermarkets without documents, at the operator's office (sometimes enough passports, sometimes - ask for confirmation of permanent residence, ie registration), and order online because most virtual operators do not have any physical presence. In this case, it takes about a week to order-deliver-activate, etc. This, too, should be taken into account, and for the first time you can take an inexpensive prepaid rate in the nearest supermarket.
Don't forget to ask for the right size card right away, so that you don't have to go to менять\вырезать
Mobile Internet is fast, convenient, and also ends quickly.

## Activation of the card
Starting in July 2017, activation is possible only on a permanent document containing passport data and address. The document is either scanned at the company's office when purchased (if purchased at the operator's office) or via videoconference on the website when activated. As of July 2017, Vodafone at the office offered to buy a tariff just for a Russian passport, O2 was denied sale to a non-resident (registration is required at least).
In July 2017, LIDL showed only a passport from different sides for activation on a video call; registration was not required, i.e. the address was not checked at all. Activation of a LIDL card under a Ukrainian passport is impossible.
February 2019 - Aldi activation via video call, you need to show your passport (Reisepass option). Theoretically, you can even choose the Russian language for the call, but the result is English. To make a call you need a stable internet connection.

## Types of tariffs
Almost all operators offer:
XX minutes, Uu SMS and VV Megabyte, and usually very few megabytes.
There are virtual operators. You can buy packets from them without calls / SMS, only data transfer. The card is sent after registration by mail or bought in a Turkish shop (without any documents).

[Good overview] (http://prepaid-data-sim-card.wikia.com/wiki/Germany) operators and tariffs.

## Estimated rates for mobile operators
A2: (in my experience, the coverage is one of the best, but 4G out of town doesn't work, LTE is not available in all packages)
In 2017, O2 offers a Smart [free access card] (http://02-freikarte.de/) with prices of 9.99 Euro/28 Days, 200 min / SMS, Internet 1GB. Can be ordered online, comes to the post office up to a week time. 

## Card refill
The replenishment options should be viewed by a specific operator. They are available:
- Buying a recharge voucher in a store or in the subway (the recharge code is printed on the receipt). For replenishment it is usually necessary to dial a combination `*100*code_replenishment# ` and the call button on the phone.  You can also enter the code through a mobile application (e.g. ALDI Talk)
- online replenishment via cards. Service [Prelado] (https://www.prelado.de/) supports more than 50 providers, works accurately with CallYa. Replenishment time is about 5 minutes.
- Another online recharge service [Aufladen](https://www.aufladen.de/en)
- Credit/Debit Card (Visa/Mastercard ...)
- PayPal

## The quality of the connection
*Data based on user feedback from Slack (there was no real voting, so the information is easy to read).

In descending order of quality:
1. T-Mobile (some virtual operators may not provide 4G)
1. Vodafone
1. O2

It is believed that real operators are better than virtual operators based on it.
