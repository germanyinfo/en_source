# План действий для получивших job offer в Германии 

A few friends have already become happy owners of offers and now they are not tired to ask me about the plan of further action. I will collect in this post a brief summary of my answers, maybe it will be useful for you as well :)

**1) [Getting a work visa at the embassy of your country] (Visa.md).**

To enter and start working in the country, you must obtain a **national** type D visa, which is also a work permit.


**2) [Search for temporary apartment] (Apartment%20 in question md)**

Before you actually move, you need to find a temporary place of residence. Usually it is an apartment or room on Airbnb or similar services for about 1-2 months. You will need to register at this location (Anmeldung, owner's consent - check in advance!) and be able to receive mail (very important in Germany!).


**3) Completion of all business in the home country and actual relocation**

There's no comment here, and I think it's pretty clear. Although it would not be superfluous to check [duties in the homeland] (duties%20%20%20Rodina.md), as well as to issue [power of attorney] (Power of Attorney.md), because it will be more difficult and expensive abroad.


**4) [Buying a SIM card and getting a local phone number] (Mobile%20 Connection.md)**

It is very convenient not to depend on free Wi-Fi networks and have the opportunity to consult with the world at any time. Also, a phone number is often needed to open a bank account.


**5) [Registration at the place of residence] (Registration%20 place%20 place%20 place of residence.md).** Sign up online in the local counterpart of the district administration - to register your address of residence. It is better to do this before coming to Germany, even if you do not know your address yet. In Berlin, pre-registration is for 2 months in advance, at [Berlin.de] (https://service.berlin.de/). The registration itself must be completed in person. During the first registration of the place of residence, an application for a tax number will also be submitted.
A useful website [MyGermanExpert] (https://mygermanexpert.com/) will help you to fill out the registration form in English. Please note the issue of religion. Taxes are levied on adherents of many religions here, ranging from 2 to 4.5% of wages in different regions of the country. No tax is levied on atheists and Orthodox (Prüflink is required).

**6) [Getting a tax number] (Taxes.md)**

 He'll come by mail to the registration address. In order to speed up the process, you can request it yourself after 7-10 working days by contacting your local tax office. Without this number, you will not be able to open a bank account (exception: online bank N26, there may be other online services) and will not be paid.


**7) [Opening a bank account and getting a card] (Finance%20 and%20Banks.md)**

In large physical banks you usually need to make an appointment by phone or through the site in 4-5 working days. You should have a residence registration document, passport, tax number, wage contract with a German employer.

You can open an account in online banks (e.g. N26) by phone or online, often no documents other than a passport are required.


**8) [Health and social insurance] (Insurance.md)**

You can register by phone, online, or at the insurance company's office, usually without an appointment. The most popular insurance among colleagues is [TK] (http://tk.de/). "Standard" insurance is compulsory, there is no big difference between insurance companies. Along with medical insurance you will also receive a social insurance number there. Both payments are automatically deducted from your salary


**9) [Search for a permanent apartment] (Apartment%20 in question md)**
Topic for a separate conversation. Very much wishing on small areas and apartments without furniture. The most popular service for finding an apartment is [Immobilenscout24.de] (https://www.immobilienscout24.de/).

**10) Filing for the Blue Card.** The set of documents must be the same as for the visa at the embassy. In many cases this is the responsibility of the employer, all you have to do is show up at the right time to submit your fingerprints and the necessary formalities. You will be given a special paper stating that you have applied for the Blue Card. If your work visa expires sooner than you receive the Blue Card, you will need to show your passport and this paper when checking your documents. Leaving the EU territory or going through visa control when your visa expires and without the Blue Card, you will need to apply for a new visa [TODO check this information].

**11) Obtaining a Blue Card.** Usually, the card is ready 3-6 weeks after its submission and must be picked up in person at the same office where it was submitted. You can congratulate yourself, challenge completed.
