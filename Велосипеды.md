#### Should I look at pedestrian or car traffic lights?

Beginning on 1 January 2017, cyclists must follow the signals of a bicycle traffic light when crossing an intersection, and if there is no such signal, then the car traffic light. Pedestrian traffic lights for pedestrians, wheelchair users and children under 7 years of age only. In case of noncompliance - fine 60 euros, in case of accident - 180 euros.

Varieties of bicycle traffic lights:
(top-down) - red, yellow, green:
- green - you can go.
- Yellow - you can't go, you can finish the maneuver.
- red - you can't go, you can't finish the maneuver.
(top-down) - red, red, green (for color blind people):
- Only middle red - you can't go, you can finish the maneuver.
- Two red ones - you can't go, you can't finish the maneuver.
You should also pay attention to the arrows at the traffic lights. Sometimes, the traffic lights are only for turning left, and you can always go straight ahead. There are crossroads with two traffic lights - for turning and for driving straight ahead.
It is highly recommended to watch the cars turning to the right, as they can slip through, go to the bicycle lane for maneuvering.

### If you need to get from A to B

##### Rental service "[Call a Bike](https://www.callabike-interaktiv.de/)"
Bicycle parking is available throughout Berlin within the S-Bahn ring. It is easier to pre-register and install the application.

##### Rental service "[Lidl-bike](https://www.lidl-bike.de/de)"
Service from a large supermarket chain [Lidl] (https://www.lidl.de/) in partnership with the DB [Call a Bike] project (https://www.callabike-interaktiv.de/). Requires [registration] (https://www.lidl-bike.de/de/registrieren) and an installed [appendix] (https://www.lidl-bike.de/de/soeinfachgehts/app). Bicycles are located in large numbers on the sidewalks along the large avenues, you can find the bicycle on the [map] (https://www.lidl-bike.de/de/rad-finden).

##### Rental service "[NextBike](https://www.nextbike.de)"
The Berlin administration held a new tender for sponsorship and Call a Bike was replaced by NextBike, whose bikes now stand in the same places where Call a Bike used to be.
The conditions are the same as those of LidlBike. 
Please note the special prices for Berlin: https://www.nextbike.de/en/berlin/prices/

Out of the bright side:
- NextBike works in many European cities
- Pretty convenient if you suddenly want to go on the subway, or the subway broke down
- The bikes are pretty heavy, but they're good for sluggish driving around town.
- Quite a few stations around the city
- Ability to leave your bike at any major intersection (at extra cost)

Some personal experience of use (situation as of May 2017):
- Quite often the bike that is marked on the map is not in place
- quite often a bike, which is free and marked on the map or on the station, may be busy (someone forgot to press the return button and just threw it away), or just inaccessible for unknown reasons
- Some people leave a bike hire in their yard and close the door, apparently to make it easier to leave in the morning - if the point on the map is not near the road, it is likely that the bike is in the yard
- At the stations, there is usually one bicycle that cannot be taken. It has a Station sign on it. It's a little misleading, like a bicycle is standing there and there's nothing to ride on.
- Despite the recent launch (May 8), some bikes do not have a seat beyond the middle - it seems to stick - check your bike before you ride
- At bikes of 3 speeds, 1st I do not know at all for whom to ride on 3rd ride in a stream of cyclists it is necessary to twist pedals very diligently, and on many bikes on 3rd speed sometimes scroll pedals
- be prepared to carry wet napkins with you, as bikes could be stained with water, bird droppings and other cyclists' dirty hands. Sometimes bikes drop, and they are dirty
- On average, it takes 10 minutes from "I want to ride a bike" to "I'm riding" to find a bike that is available and not busy. That is, a quick way to get to work is not to count on
- There are almost never enough bicycles at the stations, and apparently they are not enough in general, not enough. Bicycles are most often located in alleys, so you have to go and look for them. If you need 1 bike - not a big problem, but when you need 2 - uncomfortable. And yes, you can take up to 4 bikes per account, but bonuses such as 30min are free to apply only to the first
- the mobile app isn't very handy, but it's user-friendly. Technical support at 8 a.m. responds within 5 minutes, speaks English

##### Private rental service: "[Upper Bike](https://www.upperbike.com/en/)"

##### Rental service "[Mobike](https://mobike.com)"

In December 2017, the world's leading bike hire company, Mobike, came to Berlin, filling it with orange bicycles. Now for 10 euros a month (information as of 05.05.2018) is offered almost unlimited bicycle inside the central ring (you need to change the bike once in two hours, but given the fact that you can throw anywhere, and the cost of bikes is full, it is not so important).

- Installation of an application and the internet is required to unlock the bike
- a lot of bicycles, maybe more than anyone else's.
- Most bikes are small, heavy and without gears, but the company is fixing it, lightweight, normal size and gears have already started to appear
- The first two hours of bicycle use are free, then you can just move to another one and continue the ride
- complain about poor technical support in the google play reviews (I haven't seen it myself)

# If you need to buy

#####[New]

Don't forget to take a picture of your serial number purchase receipt and save it on your mobile device. This may be useful if you need to prove that you did not steal it.

You can buy a new bicycle on lease from your employer if it has a contract with the [JobRad] service (https://www.jobrad.org/). This is done in installments of 36 months and the monthly payments are deducted from the gross salary, which reduces the amount of mandatory payments to the employer. 

They have a 40% or more benefit for the employee on their website (in fact, 10-30%), but [there are nuances] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Fahrrad/comments/c7xx4l/jobrad/esx4uix/):
- You have to pay a monthly tax of 0.5% on the "benefit" of such a transaction.
- The price includes mandatory insurance (which is not bad).
- There are maintenance and inspection requirements.
- The bicycle will most likely need to be redeemed when the employer changes.
- The price in the shop must be at least 749 euros.

When buying a bike, the seller can write a handwritten confirmation of purchase with the date and model of the bike to prove that the bike has not been stolen by you.

An overview of what to look out for when buying: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vurwRzZ4K7A (for bikes with cassette switches). For bikes with planetary bushings, it is sufficient to check the function of the rear brake. The speed change and the duration of the inertial rotation of the wheel (should be more than 10 seconds, there should be clicks) are clear. A city bike with a planetary hub and bottle dynamo can be purchased for ~50 euros, with a Nabendynamo for ~120 euros.

In some cities there are free (with voluntary donations) bicycle workshops, designed primarily for refugees - they have tools, repairs need to be done yourself.

### Equipment
Bicycles must have front and rear brakes.
The penalty is 40 euros, but it is 10 days to fix it - you have to show the bike to the police and then the fine will be cancelled.
In the dark it is necessary to have the rear red and front white lights. Both must have a StVzo mark, i.e. they must comply with local lighting standards.
Recently, it is allowed to have battery-powered and removable lanterns.
It is also advisable to wear a green reflective vest like a motorist's.

### Safety

Look carefully at what you fasten your bike to and how you fasten it! Check the parking post or frame, whether it is securely embedded and whether there is any tape on it, as there may be a covered cut, and then even a lock for 100€ won't help. Be sure to fasten your bike behind the frame, not the wheel.

You should also not leave your bike outdoors overnight, even if it is securely fastened. It is strongly recommended that you do not leave your bicycle overnight in public places**, such as metro stops, train stations, etc. It is better to spend a couple of Euros on the bus than to bite your elbows and look for a new bike after the weekend. If you have to leave the bike overnight, it is better to have an old and rusty bike, which will not be sorry, but it will be enough to get to the bus stop.

It can also save you from stealing the place where you fasten your bike. For example, if you have a choice of fastening your bicycle a few meters from the front door or 50-100 meters from it, but it will be a busy crossroads and cafes across the street, then I strongly advise you to second (from personal experience ;-), and it's about daylight hours).
If the bike is new and expensive, I advise you to use insurance.

There are cases with unsuccessful experience of appealing to the police on the issue of searching for stolen bicycles:

> Having written a statement and reported that the bicycles had been stolen from under the house and that there was a camera there, the police said that we should find the owner of the camera and ask for a video and provide it to the police... As we understood, the chances of our bikes being returned are super minimal.

There is also a known case of bicycle theft directly from the public Fahradzimmer house where the owner lives. The theft was discovered in the morning, i.e. the theft was committed at night. The bicycle was fastened with a simple lock of a low security level.

### The theft of a bicycle

If your bicycle has been stolen and you have documents for the frame of the fork at и\или with their number, you can register the theft at [Polizei Online] (https://www.internetwache-polizei-berlin.de/).
You also need to register if your insured bicycle is stolen. The insurance company requires a case number, as well as proof of ownership of the bicycle and the value of the stolen property.
