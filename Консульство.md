Albrechtstrasse 26, 10117 Berlin [Map](https://www.google.de/maps/place/Albrechtstra%C3%9Fe+26,+10117+Berlin/@52.5238574,13.3835722,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x47a851ea09f41bfb:0x23c74fb5f7a0c5da?hl=en)

There are two options: permanent and temporary. The Blue Card comrades have a limited residence permit, which is why temporary consular registration is required.

To get registered, you need to come to the embassy during the reception hours and sign up for the consular registration window (previously there was a window number 1)

[Documents](http://germany.mfa.gov.ua/ua/consular-affairs/services/accounting/temporary):
- application; (issued on the spot at the guard's office)
- I will fill in the oblast card of the Ukrainian community, which is being sold behind the cordon for hours; (issued on the spot at the guard's office)
- a passport document or a ditini document;
- copies of the passport document or the Dietini proiznon document with the writings and documents about the document's author;
- the original and a copy of the permit issued by the competent authorities of the foreign state, which gives the right to reside in the foreign state;
- photocard with 35x45 mm size;
- certificate of registration of the place of residence behind the cord (Meldebescheinigung), seen no more than 6 months before the submission of documents for the Timeconsular consular region.
- TIP: It is better to register with the consulate in advance if there are any problems with the documents or proof for your home country that you no longer live there
- TIP: without consular records, passport is not changed, sent back to Ukraine

#### Passport (![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ru-de/faq/master/files/ua.gif))
If the old passport expires, it is recommended not to renew it, as the issuance of new visas to other countries becomes a very difficult issue.
A new passport will be issued if you give up your old one with ends in sight.
- It is possible to pay right after submission of documents in a window, recommend Somerzbank, the nearest branch [here] (https://www.google.de/maps/place/52%C2%B031%2724.4%22N+13%C2%B023%2702.8%22E/@52.5234585,13.3841032,19z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x0?hl=en)
- You'll probably have to copy something, the nearest photocopier [here] (https://www.google.de/maps/place/52%C2%B031%2723.3%22N+13%C2%B022%2746.9%22E/@52.523131,13.379687,19z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x0?hl=en)
- There is a good [report] (https://www.facebook.com/groups/ukinim/permalink/1029186617126059/) on the registration.


#### Passport (![](files/ru.gif))
Any citizen of the Russian Federation has the right to obtain a second passport "in addition to the existing one", you can come to the consulate and ask for it.

The procedure is quite simple - go to the website of the Consulate General ([in Munich] (https://rusconsmchn.mid.ru)), optionally read all the details, then go to the site to fill in the application for the issuance of a passport https://zp.midpass.ru/, where we fill in all the standard fields (first name, last name, what and where you did the last 10 years, about the army like there were also some questions, and everything like that), and then print on paper an electronic application and make an appointment. In principle, the terms are quite accessible and can usually be booked for the next week.
At the appointed time, come and stand in a live queue "and all here by appointment". As everywhere write - no bags and backpacks (strictly), with only a minimum of things (phone, keys, flashlight, remote control from the garage - you can), but at the entrance everything must be laid out of pockets and go through the frame. Phone is strictly disconnected - check that it is switched off. On the territory of the consulate itself, an electronic queue machine, poke into a button, get a ticket and wait for your number on the scoreboard.
Photographed on the spot, the signature is taken on the tablet electronically. It makes sense to repeat "the second passport several times, in addition to the existing one", and even though there was a clear choice when filling out the application, it is not always obvious to the consul - I was asked "why do you want to change your passport, but you have less than 5 years to him? - But after the answer "no, no, no, don't change, the second passport" everything is in its place. In exchange for the documents, you get a leaflet with a number that you can use to track progress on the site. Getting a ready passport without a term, Monthly from 10:00 to 12:30 in order of live queue. Official term - not less than 2, but max. 3 months. My experience is much more optimistic:
- The end of September - I filled in an electronic application, but I was going on vacation, I was too lazy to go.
- November 17 - came to the consulate and submitted documents
- December 18th - "passport ready" notification has arrived by email
- December 19 - came in and took
- The date of issue of the newest passport is "November 27", i.e. it was actually made within 10 days.

**What to pay attention to (Consulate General in Munich, November-December 2017)**

* When filling in the electronic application form, the transliteration of your first name will be done automatically and, accordingly, will most likely not coincide with the transliteration in your current passport. If you changed your passport, if you wanted to keep the old transliteration you would have to write a simple application in a free form "please keep it in your old passport as well". In case of the second passport - there is no choice, transliteration will be the same as in the main passport, even if the electronic application was not so and you do not attach any additional applications. According to the consul, "*for second passports, the spelling is always the same as in the first one*.
* Things at the consulate - no bags, just a phone, passports and paper. Leave nowhere, only on the street or at passers-by.
* Payment for the passport is accepted strictly *only by EU* card. Do not accept cash, do not accept normal cards. I had to look for a person in line with the EU card and ask him to pay for me and give him the money in cash.
* It is more profitable to make the second foreign passport before moving to the Russian Federation, it is 2500 rubles (like there was a discount, if you make it through public services), here - *777 euros *
* Myth - the second foreign passport is given for the period of validity of the first - this is not true for a long time. New passport * for new 10 years from the date of manufacture *.
