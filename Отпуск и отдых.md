# Traveling

Have you arrived in Germany and are you ready to start traveling after all the household and bureaucratic issues have been solved?

The following list of recommendations will be useful for comfortable travel:
* It is ideal to change the habit of Germans to plan their trips in advance - right after the vacation, it will significantly reduce the cost of travel.
* Look at the [holiday calendar] (https://www.feiertagskalender.ch/index.php?jahr=2018&geo=3059&klasse=5&hl=en&hidepast=0), taking into account the fact that there are different number of recognized holidays depending on the federal state. For example, Easter usually has up to 4 days, which can be a great start or end of a holiday. On [school holidays] (https://www.schulferien.org/Schulferien_nach_Jahren/2018/schulferien_2018.html), the cost of such a trip can be an unpleasant surprise, so consider this fact.  
* To navigate according to the [security guidelines] (https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice) from the UK Foreign Office, which takes into account many implicit risks, including terrorist threats. England is very concerned about the welfare of its citizens and therefore offers safe places to visit that will be useful to travellers from other countries.

  > Travelling to Tunisia on New Year's Eve in the Sahara, it was useful to know the borders of the safe territory for tourism, as even Rostourism provides vague recommendations, including insisting on not visiting this African land in 2017. In fact, it planned all 2,000 km without driving into unsafe corners and gave away.

* Check the current visa regime through [Timatic] (http://www.iatatravelcentre.com/), and only after that - buy tickets or check in
  * [List of visa-free countries for Russian citizens] (http://visasam.ru/oformlenie/free/bezvizovye-strany.html)
  * [List of visa-free countries for citizens of Ukraine] (http://visasam.ru/oformlenie/free/bezvisoviye-strany-dlya-ukraini.html)

  > Attention, everybody! Registered relatives for a flight to Sofia (Bulgaria), which is not a Schengen country, you can leave, but you can not return with a single entry visa. Unfortunately, after check-in at Ryanair, the tickets became non-refundable.

* With a national visa type D valid before the Blaue Karte is issued, you can only visit [Schengen countries] (https://www.schengenvisainfo.com/ru/%D1%81%D0%BF%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%BA-%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD-%D1%88%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B3%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B9-%D0%B7%D0%BE%D0%BD%D1%8B/). Read more about the national visa [here] (http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-10-111_en.htm)

Attention, everybody! Plastic card Blaue Karte works only in conjunction with a foreign passport. Don't forget both documents.
* Have valid health insurance before you start your trip.
* It is recommended to scan all existing documents and put them in Google Drive/Yandex.Disk.

  > Left for Szczecin without documents, forgetting to transfer the documents from the backpack to the travel bag at the last moment. The FlixBus was stopped during a police check near the Polish border (the police are also slowing down in the direction of the Czech Republic), I showed the passport photo and Blaue Karte + answered a couple of questions, after which was released.

Trevelhak: [The Miles&More Frequent Traveler Bonus Program] (https://www.miles-and-more.com/online/portal/mam/de/homepage) offers a credit card standard [Mastercard Gold](https://www.miles-and-more-kreditkarte.com/kreditkarten/miles-and-more-credit-card-gold), which includes health insurance for the traveler + full hull insurance for rented vehicles paid by the card.

#### Is regular health insurance working, [EHIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Health_Insurance_Card)
* in the EU?

  In most cases - yes, but it is better to check before the trip by typing in the search engine "EHIC name of the EU country". It does not depend on the insurance company.

* Outside the EU?

  No, but there are exceptions that depend on the insurance company. For example, TK health insurance covers medical expenses when travelling to [Turkey or Tunisia] (https://www.tk.de/tk/beratung/schutz-im-ausland/ausserhalb-euroas/348470).

You can use [Envivas](https://envivas.de) to extend your coverage for normal [TC](https://tk.de) insurance, which extends your normal TC insurance to the whole world. There are two types of insurance:
* [Individual](https://www.envivas.de/en/products-and-services/supplementary-insurances/travellling-abroad/travelxn)
* [family] [https://www.envivas.de/en/products-and-services/supplementary-insurances/travellling-abroad/travelxf]

If normal health insurance does not work, you can buy travel insurance by comparing the prices at [check24.de] (https://www.check24.de/reiseversicherung). You will be interested in Reisekranken, although there are many comprehensive offers for travelers

# Auto on the road
If you rent a car while traveling:
* Check the validity of your driving licence
  * Your driving licence is valid in Germany for the first 6 months
  * Some countries require in addition to international rights
* Sometimes it makes sense to buy independent insurance [Insurance4Carhire] (http://www.insurance4carhire.com/?curID=2) or [WorldWideInsure] (https://www.worldwideinsure.com/car-hire-excess-insurance.php) and refuse the insurance offered by the distributors, but in this case they can demand a deposit of 500 to 2000 euros, which will be returned in case of no problems

## Package vacation or a trip on your own?
Some tour operators, [Thomas Cook] (https://www.thomascook.com/) or [TUI] (http://www.tui.com/) sometimes offer more cost-effective options - charter + hotel. The advantages are flight cancellation protection, transfer to the hotel, and fixed dates, often in "tourist" locations.
