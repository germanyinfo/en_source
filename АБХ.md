## ABH (Ausländerbehörde) (http://www.berlin.de/labo/auslaender/dienstleistungen/)

Attention! The office address has changed for the Blaue Karte holders, now you have to go to Keplerstr. 2, 10589 Berlin, 4th floor

Not bad [a set of questions and answers] (http://viza-v-germaniyu.ru/rabota-v-germanii/golubaya-karta-blue-card) on blue card.

[FAQ](http://faq.germany.ru/status.db/items/63.html) on various legal statuses and related issues (Blaue Karte, NE, Daueraufenthalt-EU)


[Term in Berlin] (https://formular.berlin.de/jfs/findform?shortname=OTVBerlin&formtecid=4&areashortname=LABO)

[Term on Bluecard in Munich] (https://www.muenchen.de/rathaus/terminvereinbarung_abh.html?cts=1080627)

- When you change the address, the notification is not necessary, it makes sense if you need the current address on the card itself. In this case it is possible to go without the term (it is possible to go and on the term too), to take the ticket, do a sticker in the same day, free of charge. (They say they change it in Service Point, on the EG floor, without queues, if someone manages to get a work contract and change it with Blaue Karte there, confirm that I couldn't do it, it seems as soon as students are served there).
- In case of a mistake on the card (passport number does not match, etc.) the card will be replaced. The old card stays in your hands until a new one is issued and is replaced free of charge. You should have a photo with you or make it on the spot, in a photo machine.
- At change of the employer during probationary period (notice period of 2 weeks), if there is no possibility to reserve the term on a site it is possible to write on an e-mail `IV_B3_GPF@labo.berlin.de ` then employees of ABH will send the term by the return letter. 
- You can change the employer at any time. The first 2 years on Blaue Karte it is desirable to inform ABH before changing jobs. According to the law, it is necessary to obtain a permit from the ABH to change the employer before the change, if it occurs in the first two years of validity of Blaue Karte. I was told this information on this phone number BAMF +49 30-1815-1111, they speak English, will tell me the answer to any question concerning Blaue Karte. We need to bring a new signed contract with a salary greater than the minimum required. It is necessary to do it within 3 months after termination of the previous contract.
- Freelancing is possible for the first 2 years, but in combination with the main job.
- You can work remotely for an employer from other countries, but you can also live and pay taxes in Germany. For example, you can live in Berlin and work for an Austrian company - you do not need to reissue a blue card.
- TIP: It is better to go without the term on Monday or Tuesday, early in the morning (1-2 hours before opening).
- TIP: if it lights up with a visit, you can "catch" the term for earlier terms, someone refuses the term, and it becomes available, with great luck so you can catch the term on the next week even.
- TIP: if you suspect that you will be changing the card - take pictures.
- TIP: It's better to replace the card not during a job change, or take the work contracts with you to confirm that you are employed, the ABH may have information that you are unemployed, and therefore there may be nuances with the change of card.
- If the wife is going to study the language, it is highly recommended to ask for a referral to [integration courses] (https://github.com/ru-de/faq/blob/master/%D0%AF%D0%B7%D1%8B%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20%D0%BA%D1%83%D1%80%D1%81%D1%8B.md#Интеграционные-курсы-языковые-курсы)

### Photos
- TIP: Always take photos of all the people who go to ABH with you.

Photos can be taken in the ABH itself, look for photo machines. In ABH on `Keplerstr. 2` no photo machine, but it is on the nearest U-Bahn wanderings Mierendorffplatz or S-Bahn station Jungfernheide.
If there is a passport photo in electronic form, the cheapest thing to do is to make a template for passport photos 10x15 cm in one of the free online services, and then print this template as a regular photo 10x15 cm in a photo booth (DM, Rossmann) for 35 cents.

## Unlimited residence permit
Can be obtained after 21 months when submitting a B1 language certificate, or after 33 months when submitting an A1 certificate.
