# Life in Germany

This repository contains useful information about life in Germany, mainly in Berlin and Munich: guidelines, tips, answers to frequently asked questions. The main initial audience: IT specialists (programmers, sysops, etc.) who moved to Germany to work under the Blue Card program from the CIS, primarily from Ukraine and Russia.

You will be very helpful if you share your valuable and useful experience, correct outdated information or report it. This can be done directly in the GitHub interface: at the top of each page there is an editing button (the icon looks like a pencil). Clicking on it automatically creates your own personal clone of the repository. You can then edit the files in your clone. When ready, send a pull request to the main repository. Everything is done directly on the site, the console or other programs are not required.
