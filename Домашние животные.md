In Germany, every dog must be registered and tax paid for each dog.

You must register your dog within a few weeks of moving to Germany.

To register, you need to fill in a dog registration form (Anmeldung) and SEPA-mandate for tax exemption.

Next, go to **Finanzamt** to **Hundesteuer** and give these papers away.

You can also take your own Anmeldung, both your own and your dog's passports as well as all the accompanying pet documents, just in case.

The procedure takes about 5 minutes and as a result, a badge is issued, which is hung on the collar and presented to the police/orldnungsamt if necessary.
