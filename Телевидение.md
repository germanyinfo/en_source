## ZDF and Rundfunktbeitrag

Shortly after you move into your apartment and receive md) you can get an email from **ARD ZDF Deutschlandradio, Beitragsservice**.

The letter will contain the amount of **€17.50** (per month) - that's how much you pay for broadcasting.

> The fee of 17.50* Euro per month covers all public service television and radio broadcasts regardless of the mode of transmission and ensures free access to a wide range of programmes for all individuals. 

In other words, it is your civic contribution to the support and development of public television and radio.
It is a pseudo-tax, which is a de facto mandatory payment.

The amount is asked from the apartment, not the number of residents (relevant for students).
If there are more than one apartment, the payment is made for each one.


#### The sequence of actions

If you agree with the payment offer, you must confirm your agreement.
This can be done in two ways:

1. The best way to do this is to [fill in the form on the website] (https://www.rundfunkbeitrag.de/buergerinnen_und_buerger/formulare/anmelden/index_ger.html) online.
2. the same thing, but in a paper form - to fill in the form, which was attached in the letter, to sign and send back. It is advisable to send the so-called *einwurf einschreiben*, i.e. a letter with a confirmation of receipt. This is to ensure that the letter is not lost and that you do not have to pay fines after some time.

Some time after registration, you will receive another letter in the top right corner which will include your nine-digit **Beitragsnummer** - don't lose it - it is needed to transfer the money, and it will also need to be indicated by other family members at и\или co-habitants as proof that the apartment has already been paid for.

During registration, you will also be asked to choose how often you want to pay - in the middle of the quarter, at the end of the quarter, every six months or once a year. There are two payment options - the first is Direct Debit, when you give your company your consent to withdraw money from your card, and the company withdraws when and how much it needs. The second one, more familiar to people from the former Soviet Union, is a transfer to an account. On [the site] (https://www.rundfunkbeitrag.de/bankverbindung/index_ger.html) you can find out the necessary details for payment (they are also specified in the paper letter with the invoice) and transfer money to them regularly. **Attention** - do not forget to specify your **Beitragsnummer** in the explanation to the payment.

If you move into another apartment and receive a new application form or if you register in the new tenant's apartment, and he or she starts to receive "letters of happiness", you should indicate the existing number (Beitragsnummer) in the application form, according to which the payment is already made.
Then the same thing happens - fill out a form on the website or print it out, sign and send a paper form.

**Importantly**. If you are leaving Germany, or are moving to another apartment where tax is already being paid, you should notify the company to avoid continuing to drip tax. This can also be done via [website] (https://www.rundfunkbeitrag.de/buergerinnen_und_buerger/formulare/abmelden/index_ger.html).

If you do not agree with the offer of payment_ (or the amount), you can claim [benefits or cancellation of payment] (https://www.rundfunkbeitrag.de/buergerinnen_und_buerger/informationen/menschen_mit_behinderung/index_ger.html).
Here](https://www.rundfunkbeitrag.de/formulare/buergerinnen_und_buerger/antrag_auf_befreiung/index_ger.html) you can choose the reason for the refusal.

Most residents do have to pay this tax. Only certain categories of citizens can be exempted from payment because of disability or incapacity.
