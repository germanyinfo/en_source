#### Emergency services (Notdienst)

If you have an accident, such as a flood, or if you slam the door of your apartment leaving a key, be careful where you want to go to resolve your problem.

In Germany, there are so-called emergency services (Notdiest), which specialise in urgent matters. The specificity of these services is that because of the urgency of the cost of the service can vary from a few dozen to many hundreds of euros, depending on the time when you call and the type of problem. 

There are cases when the company has invoiced the client for 700 euros, because the call of this service to open the door of the apartment where the key was left was made by the client after 21:00 pm.

To reduce the risks, try to define your actions in advance during an emergency. Find out about the phones of proven emergency services that do their job for adequate money. Know your management company's phone number, they may be the first to help you, especially if the problem occurs during normal business hours. Usually there is information from the management company with the phones at the entrance. It would be useful to ask your neighbors if they had any such cases, where they used to go, etc.

If you call an emergency service, ask for a specific price for its services in your case. Unfortunately, this does not always save you from unexpected expenses, there are cases when the company, which, according to its website, works on both regular and urgent (accidents), sends an employee on the day of the call, despite the client's assurances that there is no urgency in the order. At the end of the job, the employee bills the company for the emergency work because the call was made on the same day and the additional bill because the work was completed after 18 hours. 

If, in your opinion, the amount of services provided is too high, there are websites of lawyers who are engaged in consumer protection, for example [https://verbraucherschutz.de](https://verbraucherschutz.de). You can find consumer complaints of all kinds ("warnungen") on such sites: [https://verbraucherschutz.de/warnungen](https://verbraucherschutz.de/warnungen/), including cases of notdienst.

According to the information on the Internet, there are cases of successful court action in such cases: [Geld zurück bei Wucher] (http://www.sueddeutsche.de/geld/ausgesperrt-geld-zurueck-bei-wucher-1.566766). This December 2017 article describes the price abuse by Schlüsseldienste and gives an overview of the prices of door opening services in Germany: [Schlüsseldienste: So viel darf eine Türöffnung kosten] (https://www.verbraucherzentrale.de/wissen/umwelt-haushalt/wohnen/schluesseldienste-so-viel-darf-eine-tueroeffnung-kosten-6687).

Often the affected customers are foreigners who do not speak German. Lack of language skills can have a major impact on the adequacy of their assessment of the company with which they conclude the contract. Also, in case of fraud, it is usually much more difficult for a foreigner to start legal proceedings with such a company than for a local or settled in Germany: due to ignorance of the language, laws, lack of appropriate connections, etc.
