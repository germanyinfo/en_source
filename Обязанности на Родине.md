# Duties in the homeland

Even though you reside in Germany, you remain a citizen of your own country and have some obligations that may have consequences if you do not comply with them.

# Russia

#### Notification of residence permit
Citizens of the Russian Federation, **permanent residents of the territory of the Russian Federation**, must notify of the existence of a residence permit, citizenship of a foreign state, as well as other valid document confirming the right to permanent residence in a foreign state.

Source - [N 62-FZ "On citizenship of the Russian Federation", Art. 6.3] (http://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_LAW_36927/85ccbff71854900d7c7a24c37ad43f0ab2fc3dfa/)

There are different interpretations of the term "permanent residence outside the Russian Federation", there is no consensus on this point. But usually (PPUF?) actual residence abroad And the absence of registration at the place of residence in the Russian Federation can be considered a significant sign of "permanent residence outside the Russian Federation". 

It is not clear whether consular registration gives any advantages.

**Submission of notification**

Notification is submitted to the territorial bodies of the Federal Migration Service (now transferred to the Ministry of Internal Affairs) within 60 days from the date of obtaining this status in person, by Russian Post or through an authorized person. If you are abroad at the time of obtaining a residence permit, you must notify us within 30 days of your first visit to Russia.

It was not clear whether Blau Karte should be considered as a permanent residence document, but the deputy head of the FMS gave a clear explanation (prauth?) 
"If the document gives the right to reside for 365 days a year, it is necessary to notify the FMS of its availability.

Penalty for noncompliance: criminal liability for up to 400 hours of compulsory work. For untimely notification of a fine of 500-1000 rubles.

#### Bank account notification
If you are a foreign currency resident, i.e. you have been to Russia at least once in 365 days, you must notify your foreign accounts.
You can do this either through the taxpayer's personal account on the website of the Federal Tax Service, or by registered letter with a notification to its tax office.

Penalty for non-compliance: administrative responsibility from 2 to 3 thousand rubles.

It is not yet clear how the authorities will be able to find out about foreign accounts of citizens until 2018, if they themselves do not notify the tax authorities. 
By 2018, it is planned to establish a banking information exchange.

As of January 1, 2018, foreign currency residents residing outside the Russian Federation for more than 183 days a year (http://gidprava.ru/accounting/uslugi/individuals/foreign-bank/, https://www.sravni.ru/text/2018/1/29/chto-izmenilos-dlja-vladelcev-inostrannykh-schetov/) are NOT entitled to submit account notices and cash flow reports on the account.
