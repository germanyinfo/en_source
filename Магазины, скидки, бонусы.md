##### Where to choose and buy various goods:
* https://www.idealo.de - a large aggregator of prices for all kinds of goods, an analogue of Yandex. Helps you find the right product at the lowest price.
* https://gh.de - also an aggregator, more focused on computers and components.

##### Local large physical electronics stores:
* https://www.mediamarkt.de
* http://www.saturn.de

* http://www.ebay.com
* " https://www.amazon.de

###### Local internet flea markets:
* https://www.ebay-kleinanzeigen.de - The German equivalent of "Avito"

#### Verification by Amazon.de
Please note that Amazon.de may require verification after placing the first order in Germany. The higher the order amount, the higher the chance of being "caught". According to technical support, the trigger works with the order amount of 250 euros or more. The check is expressed in a German letter from adressen-bestaetigung@amazon.de with a topic such as "Ihre aktuelle Bestellung bei Amazon.de - Ihre RÃ¼ckantwort ist erforderlich". Even though the letter is 100% phishing, it is an official Amazon procedure (you can find it on the Internet by looking at the subject matter of the letter and calling Amazon). Communication with Amazon will be difficult (they block your account and suspend orders), but you can call their support team (free of charge) or use the "call me back" form on the website to make sure it's not really phishing.

In short, you will need to send a **fax** (or physical mail, which is not much better) your bank card statement, as well as your card number, your phone number, address, and all other appearances and passwords. There is a known case when you had to send a picture of a bank card. The verification period is from 3 days to 2 weeks, during which time your order is likely to be cancelled and your account blocked. 

Several free online fax services: 

* [E-Post](https://portal.epost.de/) - from Deutsche Post, without noticeable restrictions
* [MyFax](https://www.myfax.com/) - free trial period 30 days, the limit is large enough, but you have to enter the card details and then cancel the subscription
* [HelloFax](https://www.hellofax.com/) - 5 free pages per account

Warned, then, armed.
