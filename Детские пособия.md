## Child benefit a.k.a. Kindergeld
Every child who is lawfully present in Germany is entitled to child benefit. It currently stands at EUR 194 per month (from 1 July 2019 at EUR 204 per month) for the first and second child, EUR 200 per third child (from 1 July 2019 to 210) and EUR 225 per child (from 1 July 2019 to 235). From 2016 onwards, a tax number is required for its issuance. Generally, the allowance is paid for up to 18 years, sometimes it can be extended to 25 years.

You can apply for the allowance at your local Familienkasse office. You will need to submit your application:

1. Application for benefits (available in English)
1. Appendix for each child (available in English)
1. Haushaltsbescheinigung is some kind of a family check. **It must not be stamped at the nearest Bürgeramt**.
The certification procedure is quick, not to mention waiting for an appointment, 5 minutes at a time.
Update: I have registered Kindergelt in Familienkasse Berlin Nord (Storkower Str. 120, 10407 Berlin),
        no Haushaltsbescheinigung certificate was required.
1. Copy of the birth certificate
1. Copy of the parent's passport and each child's passport.
1. Copies of residence permits for parents and children.
1. As of 2016, a tax number for the child (Steueridentifikationsnummer) is also required, which is received automatically upon receipt of the birth certificate. If you do not, you can order a new one via the [online form] (https://www.bzst.de/DE/Steuern_National/Steueridentifikationsnummer/ID_Eingabeformular/ID_Node.html).

Update: I registered my Kindergeld with Familienkasse Berlin Nord (Storkower Str. 120, 10407 Berlin) on July 5, 2018, and did not need copies of my passports and permits, only took a copy of my Blau Karte. They said that the Haushaltsbescheinigung certificate from Bürgeramt was only needed if the child was born outside Germany. If the child was born in Germany, the Ombudsman will issue a special birth certificate for Kindergeld, which must be submitted in the original.

If you wish to change your address or apply for a new visa/Aufenthaltserlaubnis, please contact Familienkasse!
For example, if there was a Bluecard and then you got a Niderlassungserlaubnis,
and reported to Familienkasse about visa/address changes, Kindergelt payments.
will end when the Bluecard expires.
Since Ausländerbehörde does not report changes to Familienkasse.

All forms are available at http://www.kindergeld.org/formulare.html

After you have collected the necessary documents, go to your local cash desk and submit all the documents.
The address and time of work can be found here at http://www.kindergeld.org/familienkassen/berlin.html

#### Mail-order application

Documents for Kindergeld can be sent by mail: 
1. go to [page] (https://www.arbeitsagentur.de/familie-und-kinder/kindergeld)
1. Follow the instructions
1. At the end, you will be asked to print the form + list of necessary copies of documents
1. Send everything to Familienkasse

\* from personal experience: when filling out the form on the website, they also indicated child benefits that were available in Russia; the benefit was registered to a non-working wife; it seemed that the instructions said that the letter with the documents should be sent to the Familienkasse department in Potsdam, and not the one that was closest to them

# Kinderfreibetrag
It's an alternative to Kindergeld. The point is that instead of paying out the benefit, your tax base is reduced.
In practice, this only makes sense if your total family income exceeds 64,000 euros per year.
Here is an example of how to calculate http://www.kindergeld.info/kinderfreibetrag.html

# Elterngeld
It's a parental allowance for a parent who takes care of a child. Even a person who has never worked in Germany can get the minimum allowance. The conditions are as follows:
- The parent lives with the child
- the parent is lawfully in Germany
- the parent personally takes care of the child
- the parent does not work more than 30 hours a week until he or she receives Elterngeld

The Elterngeld sum depends on the salary before the birth of the child, the total family income and ranges from 300 to 1800 Eur.
The topic is quite extensive, a good introductory article [here] (https://www.howtogermany.com/pages/parental_allowance.html) .
Forms: [here] (https://www.berlin.de/jugendamt-pankow/dienste-und-leistungen/kindschaftsrecht/bundeselterngeld/)

The application is submitted to Bezirkamt, Elterngeldstelle. Please note that this department can work several hours a week.

The Elterngeld procedure is for a wife who has not worked in Germany and is only looking after her child:

1. Application: Antrag auf Elterngeld
1. Copies of both parents' passports and visas
1. Residence permit (Meldebestätigung)
1. Document from Krankenkasse, received at birth: "Bescheinigung zur Vorlage bei der Zahlstelle des Elterngeldes nach dem Bundeselterngeld- und Elternzeitgesetz über Höhe und Dauer der Zahlung von Mutterschaftsgeld
1. Document from Standesampt: Geburtsurkunde zur Beantragung von Elterngeld
