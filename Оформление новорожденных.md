## Newborn registration
This procedure is valid for January 2016, parents are citizens of Ukraine, Blaue Karte.


#### Birthplace
You're gonna need it at the hospital at the discharge:
- Father's birth certificate + German translation \*
- mother's birth certificate + German translation \*
- Marriage certificate + translation into German according to ISO-9 by German Dolmetcher

- Questionnaire with the child's name, signed by two parents, to be filled in on the spot
- the application form may not only contain the name but also the patronymic, so it is advisable to ask the interpreter to translate the child's patronymic as well (personal experience: when registering the child at Standesamt Tempelhof-Schöneberg, even the interpreter was asked to send a letter confirming that the patronymic is translated in this way)
- parents' passports (photocopies will be made on site and returned)
- If there are other children, their birth certificates (previous child's certificate, not all of them) + translation into German \*

\* - despite the fact that these documents are in the list, they may not be requested (for example, when registering at Standesamt Kreuzberg)

**Attention**: the original documents are taken away, and in return they are given a certificate with the list of seized documents.
If there are no documents at the time of discharge, you can then bring them to the Standesamt or send a scan to the hospital email

## Standesamt
The task here is to obtain a German birth certificate, Geburtsurkunde. If the documents were not submitted at the hospital, you can do so here. The original documents are not taken away.

They will ask you "German or international" - choose only German (international means with translation of fields in different languages, only fields - not the values themselves)
It also offers the possibility of processing several original certificates, which helps to speed up the further processing of the child.
The cost of the first one is 10 EUR, each of the following 5 EUR, which is made in a week, comes home by mail or is given out in the Standesamt (the last procedure is valid for Standesamt Lichtenberg and Schoeneberg - office ±180).

##### Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg Standesamt September 2018:

Translations of both parents' birth certificates and marriage certificates are required.
Birth certificates are issued on site.

##### Standesamt Tempelhof-Schöneberg April 2019:

Demanded that the child's patronymic be translated after the child was orally provided, questioned and asked the interpreter to send an email confirming that this was the case. The testimony will be sent by mail. No queues.

### Insurance
In the letter (if indicated in the letter, and not on the hands) from Standesamt come 3 sheets of copies of the birth certificate for different instances.
Take the one that says "for medical care" and go to Krankenkasse.

1. Fill out a form for a new family member.
1. We ask for a piece of paper confirming the child's registration with the insurance company. It is needed to be able to see a paediatrician while the card is still missing.

> In the case of Technische Krankenkasse, you can show your mother's card before the child's card arrives. The insurance lady said this when she applied.

After 2 weeks, you will receive your child insurance card in the mail.

#### DAK April 2019:

Filled in the form for a new child without a birth certificate.

#### Apostille of the German Birth Certificate
Made in [Ordnungsamt] (https://service.berlin.de/dienstleistung/320315/standort/324291/) for 10 minutes and 19 euros. [Term](https://service.berlin.de/terminvereinbarung/termin/tag.php?termin=1&dienstleister=324291&anliegen[]=320315&herkunft=1) you can not take in advance, because the building has a vending machine and almost no queue

### The Ukrainian language translation (![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ru-de/faq/master/files/ua.gif))
The German certificate with the apostille is translated by a German sworn translator,
The cost of the service is 20 Euros. After that it is valid in Ukraine, as it is legalized in the prescribed manner.


### The Embassy of Ukraine: certificate of citizenship upon birth (![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ru-de/faq/master/files/ua.gif))
Page on the embassy website: http://germany.mfa.gov.ua/ua/consular-affairs/services/civil-state/birth

Help is free, it's done for a week.
Necessary documents (+copies):
1. Birth certificate (with apostille and translation)
1. Both parents' passports, 1-2 pages and valid visas. I also photocopied a plastic Blaue Karte
1. Statement (form from http://germany.mfa.gov.ua/ua/consular-affairs/services/citizenship/birth)


### The Embassy of Ukraine: Foreign passport for a child (![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ru-de/faq/master/files/ua.gif))
After the certificate is ready, we make the passport.
~Since 2016, the children have had a separate passport, such as "fit in the parents' passport" ~ (Traveled in Europe and the U.S. in the summer of 2016, a child 5 years old was listed in the passport with a photo, no problems). It is desirable to clarify the procedure at the embassy, as in January 2016 the information on the website differed from the actual procedure.

The passport is made about 2 to 3 months and costs 37 euros. It is issued for a period of 4 years for children under 16 years of age.

### The Embassy of the Republic of Belarus (![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ru-de/faq/master/files/by.gif))
All of the above mentioned is not quite suitable for the residents of the Republic of Belarus. We have a slightly different plan. Due to the fact that we do not have a division into a foreign passport and a regular passport, there are two options for the development of events:

1. Operation "Everything through the Embassy"
   1. We make PP series passports for one of the parents with all the ensuing. Cost - 225 Euro. [Pros/minuses] (https://forum.onliner.by/viewtopic.php?t=7277065)
   1. We do the translation and apostille of the birth certificate.
   1. Make a child a passport PP series.


2. Operation "I myself"
   1. We take the certificate.
   1. We do the translation and apostille of the birth certificate.
   1. Then we go to the Republic of Bashkortostan by one of the parents and make a passport for the child.
   1. If it is not possible to leave one parent with the child, we first make a certificate for the child to return to the Republic of Belarus.
   1. We go to the Republic of Belarus and make a passport there.
   1. Then we make a visa for the child and go back to Germany.

3. It's almost impossible to get a Belarusian certificate in Berlin (June 2017)
- The embassy itself does not know which document they need (birth certificate)
- This unknown document cannot be apostilled
- All German authorities actually refuse to issue non-standard documents and certificates at the hospital, the only thing you can take is a Bescheid (hospital stay certificate) and a copy of Geburtsanzeige (an electronic printout of which the hospital sends to Amt), or any other apostille is unknown how and where, the original Geburtsanzeige will not be given to you, even a colored copy of which the embassy said "no".
- Information from the embassy (http://germany.mfa.gov.by/ru/embassy/) - no information is available on the phone and no formal procedure exists, the only thing you are asked for is an "apostille certificate and translation from the German "About Birth", to be sent to the Republic of Bashkortostan for further clarifications (it is recommended to call the Republic of Bashkortostan and ask the Ministry of Foreign Affairs).
- At the reception at the embassy, even if you have all the documents (Mutterpass, hospital statements, a copy of Geburtsanzeige, certificates of U1 and U2 examinations of the child, a contract for payment of hospital stay, etc.), the embassy refuses to recognize these documents and asks for the certificate "About Birth" without indicating its name in German.
- In the Geburtsurkunde department of the Standesamt, too, they have not heard anything about any "birth certificates" - they have all the documents in electronic form and they do not issue any "left" certificates as soon as the child is born automatically in the hospital's database, and then the documents are sent to the Standesamt.

An apostille can be made only in the embassy (€35) or in Belarus itself.

Getting a passport in Belarus for a child born abroad, the main document to know about - Decree №200 of 26.04.2010.

- It is possible to go without the child, it is necessary to take with itself passports of both parents and translation of the apostille birth certificate (item 6 of article 15 of the Law of the Republic of Belarus from 28.10.2008 № 433-3), four photos 40х50мм (usual, not the person on all size as in the visa) printed on one sheet (it is desirable also scan on usb)
- The list of documents required to issue a passport is defined in Chapter 11 of Decree No. 200.
- Upon arrival, apply to the civil register office at the place of residence registration, stamp the birth of the child (necessary to cross the border of the Republic of Belarus, Decree No. 294 of 03.06.2008)
- Afterwards, go to the Settlement and Reference Center (RRC) at the place of residence registration and fill in two forms there: for registration (if both parents are registered together - it's simple), and for obtaining a passport
- If the parents are registered in different places, you still need to have a notarized written consent of the other parent that he allows the child to be registered at such an address.
- After the certification of everything in the RCC, you will either be given a pack of papers - or they will send it to the Department of "Citizenship and Migration of Internal Affairs" (if it is necessary to wait a couple of days before applying for a passport)
- Come to the Department of Internal Affairs, submit all the documents - if you pay 20 euros for the acceleration of the minimum period of 7 calendar days from the date of submission
- When ready, come and get your passport - the only difference from the usual passport - on the second page will be written the place of birth (Germany ...)

YOU DO NOT NEED TO TAKE ANY CERTIFICATES OF RETURN FROM THE EMBASSY! All you need is a photo, 2 parents' passports, translation of the apostille certificate.
