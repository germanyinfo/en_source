# Banks

### Warning
Each credit card application will be displayed in SCHUFA for 3 years.

#### General information
In Germany, banks can be online and online+offline

Online banks are usually free of charge, but online+offline banks are currently withdrawing some monthly service fee. In some banks this amount is quite immodest.

Advantages of online + offline bank - you can communicate in person, go to the office, etc. It is considered more reliable and of high quality with a wide network of ATMs, but you have to pay.

In general, look for that more suitable for you on the ratio of price to quality. 

To open a bank account, you need to register. Some banks can open an account without registration (Deutsche Bank in 2013), but this is an exception, you can try, but there are no guarantees.

The chances of an employment contract and a recent arrival in Germany are greatly increased (Deutsche Bank opened an account on 03.03.16 at Alexanderstraße 5, 10178 Berlin).

Also opened in Commerzbank, which is near the zoo, 29.02.2016. This required a passport with a visa and a work contract. Instead of a home address, he indicated the address of the office. The procedure took an hour. Cards and PIN codes were promised to be sent to the office.

#### Features of cards
- EC Karte (Girocard, VPay) - an internal payment system, introduced in Germany as a simple answer to the high Visa/Mastercard fees, is widely used in public institutions to pay duties or penalties

#### Opening an online bank account
In the English-speaking segment of the Internet there are [step-by-step instructions] (http://banks-germany.com/best-german-bank-account) for opening an account in online banks (such as Ing-Diba, DKB, Comdirect). As a rule, the procedure of account opening consists in filling in the online form, which generates a PDF file that you print, sign and send to the specified address. Besides you should pass identification procedure.   

As a rule, online banks provide a choice of two options for identification: Video identification or identification in the post office.
In [N26](https://n26.com/) biometric passport of the Russian Federation is suitable for video identification. A five-year Russian passport (without biometrics) cannot be identified online
There is a good experience of video identification in N26 with Ukrainian passports (see [#147](https://github.com/ru-de/faq/issues/147)).

**Important: **For successful online identification you need a stable and fast Internet, as well as a quiet environment, otherwise the procedure may be interrupted for technical reasons, or at the initiative of the inspector.

The remaining option is identification at the post office. The procedure is free of charge. To pass the procedure you should take your passport, PDF file with the code of postal identification, which was received at the last stage of registration at the bank, a document of residence registration.

So you go to the post office of Deutsche Post and provide the employee with the documents. The Deutsche Post employee checks your details and generates a letter that is sent to the bank.

It's simple, but there may be a problem with the place of birth indicated in your passport. For example, in the Ukrainian passport the place of birth in some cases is not printed in Latin letters due to the long name (for example: Dnipropetrovsk region /UKR). An employee of Deutche Post may refuse to identify him/her. Go to another department, where you will most likely not be refused, but will be offered to write your place of birth in Latin letters. You can show the first page of the contract with the bank, as you have already entered this information when opening an account. Make sure that the signatures in your passport and documents match. Otherwise, the identification procedure may be terminated by refusal.

Attention! He was one of the first clients of this bank. But there was a problem with N26 Black: I refused this service because it was completely useless back in July, we received a confirmation letter - yes, we canceled N26 Black, but in fact - in October I continue to pay for the month when I closed my account in N26 at all and I can't use the card, because it's been cut for a long time. At first, the support service insisted that I had to pay for another year, and after presenting their letter of cancellation, they gave me a back-up one, and insisted not to close the account.

Commerzbank experience: free of charge in the branch, without a term, in 2 minutes, and only in German.

## Currency exchange
Strange as it may seem, it will be most advantageous to change the currency in Russia/Ukraine. Coming to the EU with dollars is an unfavorable idea because of very unpleasant exchange rates.

Exchangers:

- Alexanderplatz, subway station: S-Bahn, on the first floor of the currency exchange office.
- http://www.euro-change.de/
- https://www.google.de/maps/place/Berlin+Alexanderplatz+Bahnhof/@52.5215563,13.4111577,17z/data=!4m6!1m3!3m2!1s0x47a84e1f766768eb:0x9bd67d3806e3d5c9!2sBerlin+Alexanderplatz+Bahnhof!3m1!1s0x47a84e1f766768eb:0x9bd67d3806e3d5c9

Some banks (e.g. Deutsche Bank) can take cash in USD and automatically deposit it into your account in EUR at a terrible rate (e.g. with official EUR/USD 1.17 the bank offered 1.24). The bank cannot credit cash USD to the account in USD without double conversion.

## Stock market
Many banks (Deutsche Bank, ING-DiBa, etc.) are also forward market brokers, allowing you to buy shares on world stock exchanges directly through your Internet bank. The procedure of opening an investment account takes from a couple of days (Direkt-Depot from ING-DiBa) to several months, including lost letters and other jams from the bank (maxBlue from Deutsche Bank).

Commissions for the operation are very high - about 25 euros per operation, i.e. these services are designed for long-term investment, not for active trading.

## Procedure for withdrawal of SEPA mandate
There are two different procedures.

The first is the cancellation of the payment. It is made in the case when money is withdrawn for undelivered goods or services, or just want to refuse to pay for some reason. This can be done some time after the payment has been made, usually it seems to be four weeks, but it can be less or more, according to the contract. Cancellation of the payment is done through the bank, usually just go to the relevant section of online banking and click "Cancel" next to the selected payment. It is not necessary to contact the organization that requested the payment, but it will be useful to ask what the hell is going on. The mandate (reusable) does not stop working.

The second is the withdrawal of the mandate. It is done through the organization you gave it to. The bank is not involved in this, it is not interested in it. Write a letter from the organization, saying, hiermit kündige ich mandate here with this Referenznummer. After that the organization has no right to withdraw money under this mandate anymore. The payments already made under the mandate are not cancelled.

## Sending money home
#### TransferWise
Very profitable service, at least for sending money to Ukraine. Sells euros at the market rate and sends. Has a low commission, I sent 100 euros, the commission was 2 euros. https://transferwise.com/u/igorp73 You can get 500 Euros for sending without any commission.
