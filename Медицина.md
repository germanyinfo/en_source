# Doctors and medicine
- " Emergency phone 112 If there is a threat to life, there has been an accident with the victims, serious things requiring medical care, police, firefighters or rescue services
- If you need help urgently, or on the same day, but for various reasons not to get to your doctor (the term was assigned a year later, on vacation, not working hours, weekends), and there is no threat to life, phone 116117 http://www.116117info.de/html/ 
  - He'll call Bereitschaftspraxis in your town
  - These are the doctors on duty
  - 116117 is a federal phone, usually redirected to a local
  - For example, for Berlin, a local phone [here] (https://www.kvberlin.de/30patienten/10bereitschaftsdienst/)
  - Besides Bereitschaftspraxis, there's usually another Notarzte. Basically, both can be synonyms, and can coexist
  - Bereitschaftsarzte and Notarzte can come to the house if necessary

- You should call any hotline for advice, such as your Krankenkasse. You can explain the situation and you will be told what to do, or you will be told how to get to the hospital yourself and the address of the hospital.

- If there is no risk to your life (covered by insurance tk), you can call any doctor in Berlin as soon as you get a home call: 31 00 31 http://www.kvberlin.de/30patienten/10bereitschaftsdienst/index.html

- If medical care is required, but not an emergency, and there is no risk of death, you can come to the hospital yourself. Don't forget to take a ticket in a taxi. The insurance company can pay for transport. On the premises of the hospital, look for signs to **Rettungsstelle** or **Notfallaufnahme** - emergency department. But it is better not to run around the hospital, but to ask at the reception.

HNO-Arzt Dr. Alexander Bogdanoff

- Dr. med. [Natan Del](https://www.jameda.de/berlin/aerzte/innere-allgemeinmediziner/dr-natan-del/uebersicht/80103219_1/) is a Russian-speaking therapist and not only.
- Russian-speaking therapist (on the recommendation of happycat) Dipl.Med. Elena Brener (Kottbusser Damm 24, 10967 Berlin, +49 30 6936677, https://goo.gl/maps/ko9xUpsLF3U2)
- Urologist [Roman Reunkoff] (https://www.jameda.de/berlin/aerzte/urologen/roman-reunkoff/uebersicht/81294534_1/) - despite a rather good rating, extremely negative experience of visiting. The doctor is not attentive, does not ask any questions. He made 4 mistakes in the discharge (he made a mistake in the patient's name, date of birth and dates of next visits).   

##### Blood tests (without a doctor's referral)
Blood tests can be taken at the laboratory [Institut für Medizinische Diagnostik, Nicolaistraße 22, 12247 Berlin] (https://www.google.de/maps/place/Institut+f%C3%BCr+Medizinische+Diagnostik+MVZ+GbR/@52.44373,13.3327727,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x47a85a94df42fe15:0x69b4104e7532655e!8m2!3d52.44373!4d13.33394). Accepted without term from 8:00-17:00, Monday through Friday. They speak English. The results are usually by mail, about 1 day later, but depend on the type of analysis. You can pay on the spot by cache or send the bill by mail, which will come in 3-4 weeks. The cost is about 4.19 EUR for the blood collection system and then about 2.33 EUR for each analysis.

Here [here] (files/general_blood_test.jpeg) you can see the name of the general blood test (white), leukocytes (WBC), red blood cells (RBC), hemoglobin (HGB), platelets (PLT), etc.

##### Vision
You can check your eyesight free of charge with an ophthalmologist or most opticians. In both cases, you need a term. For opticians in popular places the term for the evening may be free after 2 weeks.

[Daysoft](https://www.daysoft.com/) - convenient and affordable one-day lenses, 16.98 EUR for 64 lenses with delivery.  

##### Vaccinations
Vaccinations can be given by any therapist, and can be done without a term. The doctor asks to bring a book with the history of vaccinations. I brought a Russian-speaking one, quite old, without vaccine stickers. The doctors did not make out anything in it. But my last vaccinations were made 8 years and earlier, so I decided to put free basic multi-vaccine (tetanus, diphtheria, whooping cough, polio) and sold a German book for the history of vaccinations on the spot, for 5 euros. Immediately glued into it sticker from the made vaccine. Vaccination against encephalitis from the words of the doctor can also pay, with the recommendation of the doctor, but in general it is paid.
* Vaccinations for a trip abroad: [Website] (https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/de/ReiseUndSicherheit/reise-und-sicherheitshinweise). You have to choose a country, then in the Medizinische Hinweise section you can see Impfschutz.
* Vaccinations recommended inside Germany: [website](https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Kommissionen/STIKO/Empfehlungen/Impfempfehlungen_node.html), [pdf](https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2018/Ausgaben/34_18.pdf?__blob=publicationFile)
* Calendar of the most common vaccinations: [pdf](https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/Impfen/Materialien/Downloads-Impfkalender/Impfkalender_Russisch.pdf?__blob=publicationFile)

##### English speaking doctors (embassy recommendations)
  - UK Embassy list: https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/440519/medical_germany.pdf

#### """Making the sick leave
  - you need to make an appointment with an Allgemeinmedizin doctor, he's just `Arzt`
  - you get three sheets of paper after you're admitted to the doctor's office:
    - one for insurance
    - one to work with
    - one to remember.
  - you don't have to close the sick leave on the sheet that says the expiration date for the work
  - At work, within the first three days of leaving sick leave, you must bring the sheet to the accounting department
  
#### How to get a refund for prescription drugs from an ambulance.
  - Contact `allgemeinarzt` to see if they can give out their prescription in addition to the emergency medicine
  - if so:
    - You need to go to the pharmacy before the end of the quarter to get a refund. 
    - If the quarter is over, send the prescriptions and the receipt to the pharmacy.
