# Diploma confirmation

Information on the diploma verification procedure [on the official website](https://www.kmk.org/zab/central-office-for-foreign-education/statement-of-comparability-for-foreign-higher-education-qualifications/required-documentation/required-documentation-general-page.html) ((![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ru-de/faq/master/files/de.gif)), (![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ru-de/faq/master/files/en.gif))).
There are separate instructions for Blue Card, separate instructions for countries (Ukraine, etc.)

First of all, it is necessary to fill in [online application] (http://anabin.kmk.org/antragsformular.html?L=1).
There were problems with the registration of the application, it worked only in Internet Explorer under Windows.
> September 2017. Google Chrome for Windows 7 - no problems.
> December 2017. Google Chrome under Linux - everything works.

In the field with a description of the purpose of the application you must write Blue Card (the application will be processed faster, with priority). Only if you have a contract.

After submitting the application online, you will receive the generated application form in PDF format. File save, print, write date and sign by hand.

If you make a mistake on the form, you will need to fill in the form again and get a new file with the correct data and a different application number. You won't need the old one anymore, it's better to delete it, so as not to accidentally mix it up.

You need to attach it to your application:

1. notarized copy of the diploma (apostille is not required)
2. notarized copy of the diploma supplement (with grades)
3. a notarized translation of the diploma into German
4. a notarized translation of the Diploma Supplement into German
5. A normal copy of the secondary school leaving certificate (no translation required)
6. A regular copy of the appendix (with grades) to the secondary school leaving certificate
7. a regular copy of the main page of the passport
8. a regular copy of the contract for work in Germany (which must meet the criteria for a Blue Card)
9. all previous diplomas of education (with annexes, only copies, without certification, without translations). As a rule, if you are applying for a specialist or master's degree, you should also apply for a bachelor's degree. If you had a special secondary education or something else, you should also apply for it;
10. if the university is private - a regular copy of the certificate of accreditation of the university (without certification, without translation)
11. if the name or surname has ever changed, copies of the change documents (without translation)
12. if this does not follow from the diploma, a free-form certificate from the university about the form of education (day, evening, mixed, etc., without translation)

As a rule, the translation agency already knows how to make and certify copies and translations for the embassy.

You do not need to translate an international diploma (which includes information in English). A notarized copy of the diploma and the annex is sufficient.

You put all this in an envelope and send it to Bonn by post (a detailed address will be given on the first page generated by the pdf form). When filling in the recipient's data at the postal company's office (e.g. DHL), it is necessary to fill in the recipient's data in as much detail as possible (including the long name of the committee).
> September 2017. Courier services (DHL, Meest Express) refused delivery, arguing that as the recipient is just a mailbox and there is no contact person. Ukrposhta delivered in 8 days (by airmail, recommended letter).
> December 2017. In the Russian Federation, courier services also refuse to deliver to the PO Box. EMS (Russian Postal Service) delivered it about a week in advance. Later, ZAB referred to the unreliability of the Russian Post and offered to send a ready-made certificate to the address of the employer in Germany.

After a few days you will receive an email saying that the documents have been received and it is time to pay for the service. It costs 200 euros (if you want, you can check several documents at once, then the first one is 200, the rest is 100). Money should be transferred to bank details abroad (SWIFT). The details will be indicated in an email message. I transferred money from the card of the Ukrainian Privatbank, then the bank called and checked why I was taking the money abroad, but eventually spent it.

It may happen that payment by card in your bank will be impossible. Then there is the following solution. You open an account for an individual (physical person) in the currency of Euro, put 200 Euros in cash through the cash desk and 20 Euros of commission for SWIFT transfer at once. Come to your bank's consultant and ask them to make a SWIFT transfer. You can specify the purpose of the payment as "External educational assessment services". After the currency clearing (10 days according to the regulations, but in fact 1-2 days), your money will be credited to the account of the committee. Don't forget to close this "auxiliary" euro account at the bank when you finish all the stages.

If your bank does not know how to transfer money abroad, go to a larger bank (PrivatBank, Raiffeisen Bank Aval) and they will help you exactly.

After that, you will receive another letter confirming your payment and the beginning of the assessment.

As a result, you will receive a letter informing you that the documents were sent by regular mail to the address specified in the questionnaire. The application will include an electronic copy of the certificate.
> October 2017. It was enough to submit an electronic copy of the certificate to the embassy (sent by email to the embassy address with the case number). The original was not required.
> February 2017. Similarly, the Moscow embassy said it was enough to send them an email confirmation. Two days after sending, they issued a visa.

And finally, you get the certificates of recognition by regular mail, two of them: a short form and a long form.
You will also receive all the documents you originally submitted (copies of diplomas, etc.)

Now you have an "analogue" of the German education and can safely use a short form (and if necessary, a full form) when applying for a job.
