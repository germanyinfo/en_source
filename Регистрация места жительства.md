# Residence registration

You must register within **14 days** of moving to a new place of residence in Germany. This is only necessary for long-term stays (more than two months); short-term stays, e.g. in hotels, do not have to be registered.

Without registration, it is usually difficult or impossible to open a bank account, obtain health insurance, a residence permit, etc.

Theoretically, if you miss the registration deadline, there may be consequences in the form of a fine, etc. In practice, this does not happen or rarely happens.

## Basic information

The German registration of the place of residence is called **Anmeldung einer Wohnung**. Do not confuse the name with *Abmeldung* einer Wohnung: the name differs from the *Abmeldung* einer Wohnung: it is one letter, but it means the opposite - deregistration (discussed below).

The official service page: Berlin - **https://service.berlin.de/dienstleistung/120686/**, Munich - **https://www.muenchen.de/rathaus/Stadtverwaltung/Kreisverwaltungsreferat/Buergerbuero/Wohnen/An--und-Ummelden.html** - always check it before you register.

Useful **Print this page on paper** (use the [Als PDF herunterladen] link (https://service.berlin.de/dienstleistung/120686/pdf/) and print the pdf file you received) and take it with you to the registration process. In case of a dispute (e.g. a Bürgeramt employee refuses to register you if your address belongs to another Bürgeramt), take out the paper and appeal to it, point out specific places in the text with your finger (of course, the text must be read in advance).

## Documents and requirements

### Personal presence

Registration is only possible with personal reception, online, by fax or by mail.

Family members living together are registered together. However, if the family members are still coming to Germany, it is not possible to register them: first you register yourself and the family members register after you arrive.

There is conflicting information about whether one person can come and register the whole family. On the service page it is stated that the registration can be carried out by a legal representative (but it is not clear whether a marriage or birth certificate is sufficient), provided that the person to be registered has signed the form himself/herself. In other words, it may be possible, but it may also require the presence of all registered family members. It is believed that everyone should come to the first registration, and on subsequent moves it is enough for someone to come alone. In the end, if there is a possibility for everyone to come, it is better for everyone to come.

### Personal documents

Identity documents (passports, travel documents of the child) of all persons who are registered.

Visas, residence permits, if they are executed separately from the passport, it is also better to bring them with you.

Family status documents: marriage certificates, birth certificates of children. If not issued in Germany, with an apostille. If not in German, with translation. On the official service page it is stated that this is only required for the first registration, but it is better to take it for the following ones as well.

#### The formulary

As of March 2017, no forms are required in Munich, you are asked a few questions and everything is entered in the database.

You need to fill in **[form](http://www.berlin.de/formularserver/formular.php?402608)**. You can download it and fill it out on your computer, then print it out and sign it. It can be printed blank and filled by hand. As a last resort, you can take the blank form from Bürgeramt and fill it in there.

If you registered before November 2015, please note that the form has changed**! This used to be a few pages with instructions, a page with an application form and another page with a certificate form that was issued after registration. Now it is one page with the application form, and it differs significantly from the previous one.

One form can be used to record the data of one person or two family members (e.g. husband and wife). When you register two people, you must enter the relationship between them in the column Familienstand. The date, city and country of registration of the marriage or partnership must be entered next to the spouse or life partner.

If more than two family members are registered at the same time, several forms must be filled in (two persons each).

**Fill in the form** as follows

In the Neue Wohnung box, enter the address of the accommodation you are entering. In the Die neue Wohnung ist box, you should note alleinige Wohnung unless you have several places to live in Germany (see below). Tag des Einzugs - date of entry. Postleitzahl, Gemeinde, Ortsteil - postcode and city (e.g. 10,000 Berlin).

Straße, Hausnummer, Zusätze - street, house number. And if you do not have your name on the [mailbox] (post.md) (usually when you sublet for several months), be sure to enter the name on the box in the form *bei Müller* or *c/o Müller*.

In the Bisherige Wohnung box, you must enter the previous address at which you were registered in Germany. If this is your first registration in Germany, you do not need to enter your foreign address (you may be asked to complete it then), but you must enter the country of origin in the box Bei Zuzug aus dem Ausland Staat.

Wird die bisherige Wohnung beibehalten and Haben die unten aufgeführten Personen noch weitere Wohnungen in Deutschland?

The person information block is filled in as follows. Familienname - surname, Vornamen - name (according to the passport; in particular, if the patronymic is indicated in the passport, it should be specified in Vornamen, and if not specified, it is not necessary). Geburtsname - if the person had a different surname at birth (e.g. the wife took the surname of her husband), it should be indicated here, otherwise the field should be left blank. Geschlecht - sex (männlich or weiblich). Tag, Ort, Land der Geburt - date, city and country of birth.

Religionsgesellschaft - **religious affiliation**. This is very important because if you specify one of the taxable religions (e.g. Catholicism), a significant percentage of the church tax will be withheld from your monthly salary (8-9% of the income tax, which can be several hundred euros per year)! You can leave the field blank, or specify keine (no), or draw a dash, or specify, for example, Orthodoxy (which is not taxed).

Staatsangehörigkeiten - your citizenship (e.g. ukrainisch). If you have more than one citizenship, you must state everything.

The Ordens-Künstlername is a religious or artistic nickname that can be officially registered in Germany and you probably do not have it.

In the Dokumente box, the first and second person, respectively, need to enter the identity card data with which you came. For your passport, write RP in the column Art. Ausstellungsbehörde - the name of the issuing institution (in Ukrainian passports in this field only the number of the body is indicated, German officials may be embarrassed, in this case you can specify: *Behörde 1234*). Seriennummer - number (including series). Datum - date of issue, gültig bis - date of expiry.

#### Documents from the landlord

The rental contract is not officially included in the list of documents required for registration. However, it is sometimes asked and watched. Therefore, it is worth taking it with you. In Munich in March 2017, no contracts were asked for, just a passport and **Wohnungsgeberbestätigung** (see details below).

You also need to bring a separate document from your landlord that confirms that you have entered your home. This is a new requirement from November 2015. However, the rental agreement does not replace this document. There is a misconception that this new document is a residence permit from your landlord; of course, it is not, and no one can prevent you from registering. But in addition to the tenancy agreement (which confirms your *right* to live in the apartment), the landlord must confirm that you have really started living there.

There is no strict form for this document. It can be called, for example, Einzugsbestätigung des Wohnungsgebers or **Wohnungsgeberbestätigung**. On the official website of the registration service there is a sample: [Berlin] (http://www.berlin.de/formularserver/formular.php?402544) or [Munich] (http://www.muenchen.de/rathaus/dms/Home/Stadtverwaltung/Kreisverwaltungsreferat/fachspezifisch/HA-II/Buergerbuero/Dokumente/Wohnungsgeberbest-tigung_Internet.pdf). It is not mandatory.

Landlords may be unfamiliar with this new requirement and may sometimes refuse to issue such a document, or they may only issue it to the tenant and not to their family members. You should insist on your own and, if necessary, resort to legal assistance. The official registration page states that the landlord is obliged to issue this document according to the new law.

**Experience of 16 September 2018:** 

> When he requested **Wohnungsgeberbestätigung** from the landlord for his wife, he said that I could now issue the document myself, as I was already registered in the apartment. Bürgeramt clarified this question and said it was true. Anyone who is already registered in the apartment can fill out this form. I filled in for my wife, there were no problems with registration.

## Reception

To register, you must go to any Bürgeramt** (Bürgeramt) in person, regardless of your address. There are situations where officials try to refuse to register people if the address does not belong to the Bürgeramt. You have to insist and demand. The official service page clearly states: Diese Anmeldung können Sie bei einem der über 40 Berliner Bürgerämter erledigen.

**Munich**:
Central Bürgerbüro: Kreisverwaltungsreferat (KVR) is located at Ostbahnhof station, the exact address is Orleansstraße 50. It was not possible to sign up online, so everyone gets tickets and waits in line. As of March 2017, you can expect a waiting time of about 2 hours for your turn, so it makes no sense to come back later than 2 hours before closing (normal opening time up to 12 hours).

upd. October 17:
In the office, where it is useless to come in terms of terms, for the next month or two it is all sorted out.
At Bürgerbüro Riesenfeldstraße, the whole process took less than 2 hours and came 10 minutes before opening.
The rental contract was not asked.

upd. August 18:
Half an hour before the opening, many terms appear online in all Bürgerbüro today, and you can choose almost any convenient time.

**Berlin**:

The biggest problem is getting to the reception. There are two options: go by appointment (Termin) or in a live queue. Recently, the possibility to come in order of the live queue is removed, in some Bürgeramt still possible.

You can sign up for **Termin** on the [official service page] (https://service.berlin.de/dienstleistung/120686/) by clicking the big blue button "Termin berlinweit suchen". However, there are few terms and they run out quickly. Therefore, if possible, it is necessary to register as early as possible, one and a half months before the move, but this does not guarantee the receipt of the term (you can not register for more than two months in advance, and the terms for two months are immediately disassembled).

The only option is to periodically (several times per hour) check the availability of terms, they can appear when someone cancels their term. Get ready when you see a term available to you to specify your name and email very quickly - if you don't get there in time, the term will go to someone else.

It makes sense to check in the early morning hours, because Bürgeramt can throw a bunch of new free terms into the system.

There are some scripts for automated catching of terms (e.g. [PHP script](https://gist.github.com/ewgRa/1b515166a140bcf9ed9e)), but they can be used to quickly get into a ban. There is, or was, a term-catching startup that operates on a similar principle, and was fought by the authorities. There is an unofficial [iOS-appendix] (https://burgeramtapp.com) notifying of the emergence of new terms.

It is also possible to make an appointment on the phone. A colleague who speaks German well should be asked to call the number indicated on the website and find out the time of the nearest free term. You may be lucky enough to make your appointment on the same day.

The fact is that not all Bürgeramt are connected to the online automated booking system. You can only make a reservation over the phone. In addition, some Bürgeramt book terms for local residents.

Once you receive the term, you will receive the date and time of the reception and the term number. It should be noted that the availability of the term does not guarantee admission at the specified time. You can come with the term and sit for an hour and a half after the appointed time, with people coming in line and being accepted in fifteen minutes. At the same time, it is useless to complain or try to get into the live queue.

The second option is to come **without a term**, in the order of the live queue. Bürgeramt, which take without a term, is left a little, but they are. You should see the Bürgeramt list on the [official service page] (https://service.berlin.de/dienstleistung/120686/): The name of the Bürgeramt leads to a page with a description of the reception hours. If it says nur mit Termin or nur für Terminkunden next to the reception hours, you will not be accepted without the term. You should also read other texts on the Bürgeramt website, e.g. that they will only accept locals without a term.

**" Experience of June 14, 2016: 

> In Bürgeramt [Bürgeramt Reinickendorf-Ost] (https://service.berlin.de/standort/122311/) we managed to make a registration without a term and without a number: along with the offices, which are accepted by term/numbers, there was a separate office with a very long queue of those who came without a term.

If you can come without a term, then at the entrance to the Bürgeramt you will get a term number for today. (But it is possible that it is not for today, in this case nothing can be done.)

With the term number (obtained in advance or at the Bürgeramt), you must wait at the Bürgeramt until this number is shown on the scoreboard. Immediately after that, you should come to the table, the number of which will be shown along with the number of your term.

## Evidence of registration

At the reception you will be given a document confirming your registration right away: **Meldebestätigung**. It will contain the names of the registered persons, the address of residence, the date of entry and the date of issue of the document. The document is signed by an official and sealed with the Bürgeramt seal.

This document should be carried with you when you apply to various institutions such as banks, insurance companies, etc.

Some agencies require the document to be relatively recent (issued in the last three, six months, or even two weeks). The official service page is: https://service.berlin.de/dienstleistung/120702/ This is a paid service, it costs 10 € when issuing a document for one person. You can ask for family members to be included in the document, in which case there will be an additional fee of 5 € for each person (but only the first person will be detailed information, the rest will be listed briefly). If you need to get this document, you can get it in the following ways:

* Go back to the Bürgeramt (same or different) and ask for a new document: **Meldebescheinigung** (means and contains essentially the same, but the title and form of this document are different). It is possible to appoint Termin, it is possible to try to go without it, but not the fact that it will turn out to receive service at once on a place
* Order **Meldebescheinigung** remotely (post or email). This procedure is described on the official service page. Briefly: You will need to pay the required amount to your Bürgeramt account (details available here: http://www.berlin.de/labo/_assets/buergerdienste/bankverbindungen-der-buergeraemter.pdf). In free form, you can request an e-mail address from Bürgeramt at your place of registration by attaching a scan of your BK/NE. You will soon receive an email confirming that your request has been processed and that Meldebescheinigung will be sent by post. An example of the text of the request:

> Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,
>
> hier bitte ich Ihnen um meine Meldebescheinigung mich zuschicken. Die Kopie meiner Aufenthaltserlaubnis könnten Sie im Anhang finden.
> Am 30.10.18 habe ich 10 EUR an Pankower Behörde (Postbank) überwiesen.
>
> Meine Postanschrift lautet: <Name, Familienname>, <Adresse>
> Danke sehr im Voraus.

In addition to these two documents, the address of residence is also indicated on the back of the residence permit in the form of a card (see below). In some cases, it may be sufficient to show the card to confirm the address.

## Moving away

If you are already registered in Germany and are moving to a new address, you do not need to cancel the previous address separately, just register the new one in the usual way. You will need to enter your previous address in the Bisherige Wohnung block on the form.

After the registration of the new place of residence, the information about it is transferred to a central database, and from there it can be received by the interested institutions and enterprises, such as [ABH] (ABH.md), [insurance companies] (Insurance.md), [banks] (Finance%20 and%20Banks.md), etc. Therefore, it may not be necessary to inform them about it at all (but it is better to contact the insurance company, bank and check that they know your new address, if necessary, send them a confirmation of registration). For example, the insurance company will automatically re-issue your card and send it to a new address.

Previously, you could indicate on the registration form whether or not you want to be notified to third parties. Accordingly, it was possible to prohibit it, and then you had to inform the insurance company, the bank, etc. about the move yourself. There is no such option in the new form.

If someone still has your old address, they can send you letters (including very important ones). You can activate a paid [mail forwarding service] (https://www.efiliale.de/efiliale/nachsenden-lagern/nachsendeservice.jsp?cid=DP_101002152) to a new address within 6, 12 or 24 months.

If you have a residence permit in the form of a card, you need to go to [ABH] (ABH.md) with your residence permit and proof of residence registration. ABH will stick a free sticker with a new address (over the old address) on the back of the card.

If you happen to have registered a new address after you have applied for a residence permit and before you receive it, the residence permit (if issued in the form of a card) will have the old address on it. In this case, take the confirmation of registration when you go to receive the card and immediately ask for a new address.

## Check out

You should only cancel your place of residence ("check out") in the following cases:
- you will no longer live in Germany
- you have [multiple residences] (#Number of residences) and one of them is the one you stop living in.

You do not need to cancel your registration when you [move] (#Moving).

The deregistration service is called Abmeldung einer Wohnung (not to be confused with *Anmeldung* einer Wohnung - residence registration). The official service page is: https://service.berlin.de/dienstleistung/120335/

Unlike residence registration, it is possible to deregister without personal reception by sending documents by mail.

It is allowed to cancel the registration not earlier than 7 days before and not later than 14 days after departure.

## Several places of residence

You can officially register several places of residence. In this case, you must declare one of them as the main place of residence (Hauptwohnung) and the others as an additional place of residence (Nebenwohnung). On the residence registration form, you indicate that you are keeping your previous place of residence and that you are registering a new one as Hauptwohnung or Nebenwohnung. Or you leave your old address and register several new ones at the same time. You must also submit [another form] (http://www.berlin.de/formularserver/formular.php?402610).
