# Transport

Those who are registered in Berlin can buy VBB Monatskarte with a good discount (for 63,42 EUR). To do this, you need to come to VBB customer service center with Anmeldung, ID card and bank card. You will fill in the form and receive the card by mail. For the time being, you will be issued a temporary Monatskarte (Startkarte) for which you will have to pay (I have run out of 53 EUR from the 4th day until the end of the month). I went to the center on Alexanderplatz, where they speak a little English, enough to help fill in the form. 

You can also order Monatskarte via the [VBB] website (https://www.abo-antrag.de/):
 - Visit https://www.abo-antrag.de/neuantrag
 - Fill out the form (Monatskarte will be personalized and can be restored in case of loss)
 - You will receive an email with a link to confirm your registration.

The advantage of this method is that you do not need Anmeldung.

The cards are sent by paper mail on the 20th day of each month and will be valid from the first day of the next month (If you register after the 10th day of the next month, the card will be sent the next month, not this month). To close the period, you can buy a Startkarte by going to one of the customer service centres and showing a printout of your registration confirmation e-mail (subject: "ABO-Online: Bestätigung Ihres Neuantrags").

- The pass (Wochenkarte, for example) must be composted once, not every time you travel.
