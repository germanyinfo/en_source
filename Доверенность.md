# Proxy execution at the Ukrainian Consulate in Berlin
I had to deal with the issue of a power of attorney to resolve issues in Ukraine. By a lucky accident, I made almost no mistakes. I did not find any information on how to do it correctly with a detailed step-by-step algorithm. You can also not count on the help of the secretaries of the consulate.

## It is better to take care of the powers of attorney in Ukraine
1. It's much cheaper. Usually the ratio is about 3-5 times depending on the type of power of attorney. In Ukraine, UAH 350-500, in the Consulate - 60-120 euros. Prices of the Consulate in Germany can be found here] (http://germany.mfa.gov.ua/ua/consular-affairs/consular-charges)
1. If you are a couple, you should make a power of attorney for each other, so that anybody who comes to Ukraine could solve the issues for himself and for a partner. Otherwise, there will be no possibility to delegate and distribute efforts. The trip of one of the partners is not always possible, the banal saving of time and money can not be mentioned.
1. If you have a trusted person in Ukraine, you should leave a power of attorney to him. Mother, father, brother, sister, even a good friend can be very helpful and help to avoid trouble. Let me remind you that a power of attorney is not only a general one.
1. A notary in Ukraine will prepare a document for you according to your requirements and wishes, it is included in the price. You bring a ready-made document to the consulate, which they only certify. Detailed consultations, examples, not to mention the finished text of the power of attorney at the consulate, you will not receive.
1. A notary in Ukraine will immediately register your power of attorney in the electronic registry, which guarantees its applicability. With the consulate there is a nuance about which a little later.
1. In Ukraine, you will receive a power of attorney on the usual form. There are no forms in the consulate, you will be given an ordinary white sheet of paper with the seal of the consulate and the signature of the secretary who issued it to you. Many organizations and government agencies in Ukraine are already only this leads to stupor.
Any power of attorney issued by the consulate must be registered upon arrival in Ukraine.

## Power of Attorney at the Consulate in Germany
1. You are looking for or preparing the text of a power of attorney. No one can help you with this. Ideally, you will find a notary in Ukraine who will remotely agree to help. Or ask a friend or family member to come to the notary and put together the document you need.
1. You take care of the correct dates, surnames, places and other things. The consul will take a receipt from you saying that you have no complaints about their work.
It is not possible to pay the consular fee on site. You will be given the details to pay either at the bank, which is not easy and expensive in Germany, or from your account, but then you need to print the payment and bring it to the consulate. No one will tell you what you can pay from the account. Many people rush in search of a bank and pay 15-20 euros for the payment just by habit. It is better to clarify the amount of payment in advance at the consulate, and a personal visit. They answer by mail, but usually very evasively and not faster than 2-3 days later.
1. In our experience, the notary secretary was not very busy and there was no long queue to him.
1. the text of the power of attorney should be brought on a flash drive. Then they will quickly arrange it with their title and ending, print it out, let you read it and if all is well, you will sign it. After that they will sign it themselves and stamp it. Read carefully, in my case the consul made a mistake in the dates. If you find this out after everything is done, you will have to pay for the new power of attorney.
1. IMPORTANT: Along with the power of attorney, you will also be given a document, let's call it an Act, which is essentially a description of your power of attorney and contains a lot of useful information about where, how and by whom it was given out. It must be saved! I was not told about it and this document can be easily perceived as unnecessary.
1. A power of attorney stamped and signed by the consulate secretary does not work until it is registered in the unified electronic state power of attorney register. In private relationships and some public bodies, this may not be an obstacle. But for example, in a bank, your power of attorney will be checked for registration and if it is not, for them it is an empty piece of paper, though with a beautiful seal and the signature of the secretary of the consulate. To register a power of attorney you need a visit to the Ukrainian Notary, who will do it for you only in the presence of the same Act. I wrote in paragraph 6. Without it, he will most likely also not be able to help you and your power of attorney will have no legal effect.

## My actions in Ukraine
- I took a power of attorney with me to Ukraine
- I registered it with the notary, look for the right one.
- Successfully used his wife's individual entrepreneur (FLP) to close down, as well as several bank accounts, and they are checking very carefully.
- Already in Ukraine I have issued a power of attorney for my mother not to repeat mistakes and publicity with the consulate. It is also much cheaper.
