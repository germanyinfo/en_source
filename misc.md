## Movie / music download 

Distribution / receipt of torrents without additional software is not recommended. If you do not want to get a claim with the amount of several thousand euros (there are a lot of precedents). 

Here] (http://www.allrussian.info/index.php?page=Thread&threadID=141831) you will find detailed instructions on what to do if a "letter of happiness" does come.

Below are the ways to avoid such problems.

#### Universal solutions - VPN
- http://airvpn.org
- https://vpn.ht/ - cheap ($5 per month after the trial period) and reliable
- Sync by honeybunny http://hidemyass.com/
- http://www.vpngate.net/en/ - free VPN catalogue worldwide (not all stable)
- http://prosto.net.ua - Gigabit VPN to Ukraine for $5 per month
- https://zenmate.com/ - there is a free plan (and it is also cheap to buy a premium of 23+ countries)

### Special solutions for torrents
- https://bitport.io/ - convenient and free of charge with a lot of restrictions, but you should pay at least for HTTPS
- https://zbigz.com/ - roughly the same
- http://seedbox.org.ua - alternative from Ukraine (only paid tariffs)

### Plugins for media files
- https://proxtube.com/ - free plugin for Chrome and Firefox (to unlock music/video on youtube) (believe me, [GEMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEMA_(German_organization)) - a very evil organization, a lot of things are blocked)
- [vk-downloader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vk-downloader/mlmfhhpkbbnhnalidmpgkpmmmgfhooeh), etc. - allows you to download movies and music from VK (there is no clear opinion about watching/listening online, if the content is not distributed, then you can)
