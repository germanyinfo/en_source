# An important clarification

**In this document, there are general rules and features for sorting garbage that you may encounter. The rules may vary depending on many factors: land, city, housekeeping, etc. For more information on how to sort waste, contact your Hausmeister or the garbage disposal company. In Berlin, this is BSR: https://www.bsr.de/**

Part of the information is taken from the post of Sergei Vasilyev from [November 6, 2016] (https://www.facebook.com/sergey.vasilyev/posts/10205938874269863).

# Containers inside the house

Most houses can have up to 5 types of containers (depending on the area, landlord's contract and other things). Example: BSR booklet [Wohin mit Ihrem Abfall?] (https://www.bsr.de/assets/downloads/BSR_Muellplatzschild_2016.pdf).

## Paper and cardboard (Papier. Blue container):
  * Newspapers, magazines, boxes, cardboard
  * Paper packaging
  * brochures, catalogues
  * Books, notebooks, writing paper
  * envelopes. If there is a plastic window, tear it off and throw it in the package

## Packaging (Wertstoffe. Yellow container)
  * Any packaging of food products, e.g. cans, yoghurt, cheese, milk, chips
  * Glass can lids, beer lids
  * all the recyclable markings with the arrows of a triangle
  * plastic bags, shampoo detergent packs, etc.

  * colored

**Not included**: bulbs, porcelain, crystal, mirrors, window glass.

The number of glass containers depends on the house and the garbage disposal contract. Similar containers can also be found on the streets.

All recyclable waste and glass should be rinsed to avoid leaving any residue.

# Large garbage

That's where they come in:
* large furniture
* large-size electrical appliances. Find out more at [link](https://www.bsr.de/elektrogeraete-20292.php)
* old unsuitable bikes, wheelchairs, etc.
* old carpets and mattresses
* laminate, door frames and doors, window frames without glass
* Plastic parts: chutes, pipes, tanks, bathtubs, etc.
* Textile waste

**" Don't go in...
* construction debris
* tires and batteries
* Cast baths
* varnishes and paints

For the removal of bulky goods, a machine must be ordered in advance.

Some large equipment stores offer the possibility of removing and disposing of your old equipment. This should be checked with the shop. All electrical appliances such as mobile phones, hairdryers, televisions, etc. can also be delivered to Baumärkte free of charge (see above for a list of partners).

# Toxic waste

Toxic waste, such as paints, varnishes, etc., should be taken to special collection points. List of collection points for Berlin at [link] (https://www.bsr.de/schadstoffe-20363.php).

# Leaves and garden waste

They're exported separately. Must be packed in bags. You can order removal in spring and autumn. More information can be found at [link] (https://www.bsr.de/gartenabfaelle-23508.php)

# Clothes

Whole clothing can be carried in special metal containers, which stand at the corners of the area and often near the churches. Clothes can then even be sold in second-hand clothing stores or distributed to those in need. Clothes are in poor condition and rags can be thrown in the rest of the garbage (black container).

You can find the nearest garment container by keyword request in Google / Google Maps "kleiderspende container". 

You can also find a map of the containers here: 
* [Humana containers](https://www.humana-kleidersammlung.de/kleiderspende)
* [DRK - Deutsches Rotes Kreuz containers](https://www.drk.de/hilfe-in-deutschland/existenzsichernde-hilfe/kleidercontainer/)
* [List of all clothing collectors and links to their container locations] (https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Deutsche_Altkleider-Container_Betreiber)

But in general, it is better to try to find second hands for clothes through [ebay-kleinanzeigen] (https://www.ebay-kleinanzeigen.de/stadt/berlin/), FaceBook Marketplace.

You can also neatly arrange good things on the street, with "FREE"/"Kostenlos" written on it.

# The other one

Exceptions:
* Beer bottles (plastic and glass), plastic soda and water bottles, beer and soda cans and soda cans are often marked as recyclable or reusable. Such containers must be delivered to special vending machines in supermarkets (in rare cases to the supermarket staff), because you pay bail (Pfand) for them. The amount of bail varies from 8 to 25 cents depending on the packaging and is usually indicated on the price list. When you return the tare, you will receive a receipt that can be cashed at the store's cash desk or partially paid for by the store.
* Batteries separately in special boxes. Often located in supermarkets or shops Rossman, DM
* Dispose of wine in BSR points (see above) or in some schools, clubs, churches, supermarket chains, pharmacies and beverage stores. These include, for example, the Budnikowsky pharmacy in Hamburg or the national Jacques Weindepot.

New Year's trees should be thrown out on the street near the road from 7 to 21 January. A car passes through the neighborhood and collects them. For example, the 2017 tree removal schedule for Berlin can be found [on the link] (https://www.bsr.de/weihnachtsbaeume-20411.php).
