# Administrative and criminal responsibility

Do not put the goods in your bag, backpack, etc.
There is a real case when such behavior was perceived as theft, despite the fact that the visitors of the store were at that moment inside the store and were going to the cash register to pay for these things.
The police were summoned and a criminal case was opened.

Art. 242 German Criminal Code.
As a rule, it is not allowed to put items in a bag hiding them from the unobstructed view of the owner of these items. The theft or its attempt can already be committed while in the store, i.e. without leaving it.

# Housekeeping

It will not be superfluous to keep the documents with your signature for 10 years (it is necessary to specify 10 years or 3 years). In case of which you will be able to show them.
